brazils latest funk sensation anitta has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour antidiscrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industrys fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middle class market the controversy was prompted by the publication of thenandnow photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anittas skin tone since she signed a deal with warner in the first when she was relatively unknown she looked darker in the second a marketing shot after she became famous she seems paler whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or more likely photoshop tweaks the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in brazil jarid arraes a psychology student and blogger wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anittas image change represented people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy but the statistics show that is far from the case the whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesnt support diversity white is the image of the rich the nice the successful the good while people see black as the opposite of all that born larissa de macedo machado the divatobe was a church chorister in her childhood in her teens she made a name for herself in rio de janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer she has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single show das poderosas which topped the charts and attracted million youtube views though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixedrace shanty towns on rios hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below she has toned down the suggestive dancing gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk now however questions are being asked about whether she or her marketing team have gone too far in retailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic if pop stars have curly hair they are going to feel coerced into straightening it if they have a big nose they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty said arraes it creates a vicious cycle for selfesteem this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixedraced nation brazil one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery has the largest population of african descent outside africa but race and ancestry are less important here than colour and despite the nations goal of being a multiracial democracy there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality in brazilian cities white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent up until black or mixedrace students also spent two years less at school on average the government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action but the gulf remains glaringly apparent the vast majority of business and government executives are white while most menial jobs are done by black and mixedrace workers walk through ipanema gvea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child defining colour is complex people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in among the million population million said they were pardu mixed race million black two million asian and indigenous sylvio ferreira a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone was this achieved by racial whitening no he said what happened was a change of the social space where anitta produced her art from the periphery to the centre others agree that the issue of colour is overblown maycon de mattos batista a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern said there had been a huge change in anittas image but not of her colour i dont believe its whitening its more the way they are producing her with makeup hairstylists and the way she dresses he said i dont think that was because of pressure being put on her she always liked to show off sing and dance that was a natural thing for her i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today leandro silva de souza a racial equality activist in the northeastern city of salvador said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives the public he said proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing ellen olria a black lesbian as the recent winner of the talent show the voice brazil the guardian was unable to reach anitta for comment but in a recent interview she described the need for identity to be selfdefined allpowerful is a woman who doesnt need to be beautiful but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous she is powerful what i try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want n,adv,Anita

back in when blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone the company was just entering its boom times while the iphone was still a gleam in steve jobss eye blackberrys innovations ensured its smartphone was one of canadas biggest exports six years later in the summer of as violence engulfed london and spread to birmingham nottingham liverpool and manchester so effective was blackberry messenger bbm at mobilizing the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down but two years later it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug as demand for blackberry handsets fades the once noisy bbm grapevine is falling silent dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place from facebooks and apples ownbrand instant messaging applications to independent startups such as whatsapp and kik which is also canadian free to download and use they use the internet to swap text messages pictures voice clipsstickers and even videos in whatsapps case between most types of phones in an attempt to retain its following bbm has been released on android and apple phones despite the competition the response has been overwhelming with an announcement that there have been more than million downloads but despite the initial interest many believe bbms wider release will do little to save the service the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late says james gooderson an yearold student who blogs on technology whatsapp has removed the reason why young people would use a blackberry bbm claims million monthly users after its upgrade but whatsapp has million other services expose bbms limitations unlike skype and viber it does not yet offer video or voice calls unlike path it does not do location sharing there is no video sharing as on imessage and the stickers a more sophisticated version of the smiley face adored by kids the world over are also unforgivably absent even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry handsets have not migrated to the apple and android versions messaging is moving from verbal to visual photos uploaded to instagram trigger a wave of comments and snapchats pictures which selfdelete after ten seconds have opened a world of other possibilities like bbm all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection yet as recently as bbm was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in egypt and at the time of the london riots it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen we could see on our blackberry messages where the rioters were going next tv news would catch up four hours later said jean pierre moore he manages a youth club in stockwell south london an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in britain moore mainly communicates on an ipad now he dismisses the notion that the bbm curfew urged by some mps would have stopped the looting the social networking wasnt the reason he says i know a lot of people who were out rioting people had been angry for a long time mention the words stop and search around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men nearly of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application says the research firm enders analysis but twothirds use more than one among to yearolds use facebook every day but use alternatives its a much more complex multifaceted environment says benedict evans a digital media specialist at enders the smartphone itself has become the platform all of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library apps rise and fall like fireworks some like instagram last others disappear into thin air thirteenyearold bennett has three devices all handmedowns from family members he keeps his blackberry for messaging uses an iphone over wifi to play games and makes phone calls on an htcbranded android phone his friends are still on bbm the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all blackberrys at the touch of a few buttons a single blackberry message can be sent to the phone owners entire contacts book several hundred people in some cases on whatsapp the limit for a broadcast message is but for bennett instagram is now a major social network instagram is facebook without parents he says facebook has been taken over by the older generation once i saw my mum on facebook i deleted my account for families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a blackberry retains its appeal unlimited bbm messages are available to anyone with a secondhand device and a amonth deal from tmobile but trust in the privacy of bbms system has been eroded part of the attraction to business people revolutionaries demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the companys secure servers could not be traced back to their writers prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief across town from stockwell outside the gates of a private school in wellheeled south kensington the older pupils all have apple logos on their handsets they all use whatsapp for many bbm is a distant memory i still have a blackberry but im the only one says a teenager standing with a circle of friends and how does that make him feel isolated he repliesn,adv,Blackberry

brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavyhanded policing poor public services and high costs for the world cup the major demonstrations in rio de janeiro so paulo brasilia belem belo horizonte salvador and elsewhere started peacefully but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses the large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings coinciding with the start of the confederations cup a world cup test event the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services lavish investment in international sporting events low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption while the vast majority of demonstrations in rio were peaceful several police were injured in clashes at the citys legislative assembly at least one car was overturned and burned and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices the unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming revolution down with paes down with cabral the mayor and state governor and hate police police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more the guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm the causes pursued by the protesters varied widely we are here because we hate the government they do nothing for us said oscar jos santos a year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the rocinha favela im an architect but i have been unemployed for six months there must be something wrong with this country said nadia al husin holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education at a far smaller rally in brasilia demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the highsecurity area of the national congress several climbed onto the roof in belo horizonte police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a confederations cup match between nigeria and tahiti in porto alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in curitiba protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor there were also rallies in belem salvador and elsewhere in so paulo which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully reflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests some in so paulo where numbers were estimated at between and carried banners declaring we come from facebook most protesters were young and for many it was their first experience of such a giant rally my generation has never experienced this said thiago firbida a student since the dictatorship brazilians never bothered to take over the streets they did not believe they had a reason to but now brazil is once again in crisis with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting comparisons have been drawn with rallies in turkey and elsewhere another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore guy fawkes masks associated with anonymous and the occupy wall street protests brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas as well as the cent revolution due to the bus price rise and the passe livre after the demand for free public transport some said the protests felt unbrazilian but liberating our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes they enjoy partying rather than protesting but something is changing said deli borsari a yearold yoga instructor following widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums the confederations cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests before the opening match in brasilia crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police footage showed frightened japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children as the sound of shots perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas was

it could be the best thing since trevor bayliss windup radio in the preinternet s a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosenefuelled lamps in africa and indian but when british designer patrick hunt went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially he hit a problem we tried to get funding to make it happen but its slow and complex and its unproven and nobody wants to take a risk he saidn so he tried crowdfunding on a us website indiegogo which had recently opened up in the uk within five days he had hit his target and raised so popular was his campaign at the end of to entice donations from the public that within days he had raised a colossal the led light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a kg bag of rocks the weight is attached to the light lifted to a height of about m and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of lightn hunt is preparing for production in china and will test the market again by delivering of the lights to africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of unitsn he is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fastgrowing crowdfunding industry for finance another new site is investingzone which matches wealthy individuals with startup entrepreneursn indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer perks for different levels of donation those helping to fund hunts innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own lightn for danae ringelmann cofounder of indiegogo the gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea it is the first time that finance has been fast efficient and meritocratic because it is not about how do i get access to the decision makers in that bank or who do i know in that venture capital outfit this is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans getting them to validateyour idea and fund itn even ideas that arent deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and getting smarter faster she saysn ringelmann who is based in the us started her career as a wall street analyst in she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise moneyn the site was originally focused on the film business and launched at the sundance film festival that yearn five years on and it is raising about m a week for new businesses in startup and growth stages in december it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the atlantic and says britain is its third biggest market international activity is up since decembern there is no shortage of competitors be it kickstarter seedrs or funding circle but unlike rivals says ringelmann indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign no project is deemed too wackyn the site levies a fee for successful campaigns for those that fail to raise their target amount users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a feen a british woman lauren pears raised to open a cat caf in london through the siten known as lady dinahs cat emporium it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair a hot cup of tea a book and a catn weve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it it could be a gadget that no one cares about said ringelmannn the entrepreneurs do an indiegogo campaign they dont even actually launch the project but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this it allows you to test your market test your pricing test your features discover new revenue streams get vital feedback says ringelmann with her wall street background and the experience of helping businesses and services raise finance ringelmann has finetuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur ideas are a dime a dozen its all about the execution and if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you then you are not the right person to execute that idea its all about confidence to move fast and to learn she says for ringelmann the expansion into europe and a deal with a web transaction provider which will allow payments to be made through local card services like maestro in the uk and carte bleue in france as well as paypal are part of a dream to democratize finance more than campaigns for finance are live on the site while crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown it has limited appeal to bigbucks investors who dont settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business that could start to change in the uk with the launch of investingzone n,adv,Crowdfunding

unusually for someone who likes to chat kenton cool can barely speak exerting himself at high altitude has left his voice a throaty growl he is now in kathmandu the capital of nepal having flown down from everest base camp that morning cool is reflecting on a startling sequence of climbs completed over the course of the previous weekend early on saturday morning he reached the summit of nuptse the first and lowest of the three main summits in the everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the western cwm that same day he climbed up to the summit of everest itself reaching the top in complete darkness early on sunday he and his climbing partner then continued on to the summit of lhotse the third of this spectacular threepeaks challenge on monday morning it was a snatched opportunity he says for the first time since the late s there were fixed ropes on all three mountains that doesnt take away the physical achievement of what i did ive set the bar at a certain level but whoever comes along next will move the bar further and do it without ropes or bottled oxygen sixty years after everest was first climbed much of the coverage is looking back to edmund hillary and tenzing norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental degradation ive asked cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing years from now i hate to think he says but mentions the swiss climber ueli steck who fled the mountain in april following what cool terms an altercation with a crowd of sherpas at camp steck he says was planning to climb everests west ridge first done in descend to the south col and then immediately climb lhotse via a new route all without fixed ropes ueli had been training like a machine cool says hes a climber in a class all his own hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to an astronomic level it would have been amazing to see what he could have done what tourism will look like is another matter one clue is in the stunning helicopter rescue performed by simone moro stecks climbing partner whose intemperate language provoked the confrontation at camp moro flew back to everest on tuesday at the controls of a high powered helicopter to rescue a stricken climber at an altitude of metres it was the highest rescue yet performed on everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years by the infrastructure on the mountain could include a helipad on the south col bringing tourists breathing bottled oxygen in the meantime they are transforming the potential for rescuing both climbers and the far more numerous trekkers heading as far as base camp whether the everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector remains to be seen according to mountain geographer and environmentalist alton byers the combination of climate change and tourism he says is creating new stresses on the sherpa homeland the retreat and in some cases disappearance of glaciers in the everest region are having a major impact already everywhere you go people are talking about how theres less water theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built in the sherpa town of namche bazaar he says a new fivemile pipeline is being laid to bring water to service the growing tourist demand for showers and flush toilets the local stream has become contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that in high season is bursting at the seams every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world he says human waste at base camp is now managed well and removed in plastic barrels but according to byers these barrels are emptied into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that could leak into the regions watercourses these problems can be solved but we need to get serious about it he says one climber can spend climbing everest and thats fine but at some point were going to have to address these other priorities for half a million dollars a year you could solve most of them climate change is another matter byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan for the impacts of climate change most usually finding new water sources or introducing rainwater harvesting the rapid buildup of glacial lakes that threaten to burst and flood the sherpa homeland is a constant threat theres going to come a time when people are going to have to get out of their way changing weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism increased cloud cover in periods of normally clear weather is closing lukla airport the gateway to the everest region more often a new road for xs is being built to lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money but byers is concerned that the rapid spread of the road network in nepal is being done on the cheap with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides everest is the icon everyone knows he says its the canary in the coalmine that everyone understands its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to address some of these problems like the impacts of climate change and tourismn,adv,Everest

fit in four minutes it sounds like a headline from a health magazine an unattainable promise on latenight satellite tv then you attempt dr izumi tabatas training protocol seconds of allout effort seconds of rest repeat eight times and between sounding like darth vader as you desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a messy bundle of sweat and defeat you realize just how wrong you were tabata has seen it all before they were dead he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his university students in the early s after four minutes hard exercise they were wiped out but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised we all were his research followed extensive monitoring of japans speed skating team in the early s when he along with the teams coach irisawa koichi noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment one group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week the other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike followed by four minutes of tabata intervals four times a week plus one minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals the results were startling after six weeks of testing the group following tabatas plan exercising for just minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by and their vo max a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power by the control group who trained for five hours every week also improved their vo max but by and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity we have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol says tabata and there is also forthcoming research that shows that it lowers the risk of diabetes in humans something we have already shown in rats but there are no halfmeasures here you cant go steady on a cross trainer chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello the regimen demands headdown bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints or suchlike remember how you felt after doing a m sprint at school imagine doing eight of them with only a ten second break to recover allout effort at of your vo max is the criterion of the protocol says tabata if you feel ok afterwards youve not done it properly the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard in the original plan the aim was to get to eight but some only lasted six or seven as one commenter on the popular exercise forum tnation puts it when done correctly you should meet god most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldnt even try tabata doesnt completely agree everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them he explains he says that he will soon publish research showing that doing the programme just twice a week less than half the volume in the original research still provides significant health benefits another soontobepublished finding which tabata describes as rather significant shows that the tabata protocol burns an extra calories in the hours after exercise even at rest due to the effect of excess postexercise oxygen consumption so while it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fat its slightly surprising therefore that the plan is still the preserve of the serious athlete and musclehead crowd although that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal with universal studios that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and while i am honoured that people are doing it some are doing it wrong because they dont realize the intensity you need to work at says tabata so should we all start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens richard scrivener a former assistant strength and conditioning coach at northampton saints rugby club says that while the benefits are clear tabatas are an addition not a replacement to a favoured sport or training method runners for instance need a high level of running economy which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles says scrivener but they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing tabata training this will unload the skeleton and give joints the chance to rest and recover especially if one is prone to niggles or has a history of injuries and you would probably therefore get more out of the long runs when you do undertake them gym rats can

imagine that you read a headline fit in four minutes in a health magazine would you believe it well dr izumi tabatas training programme seconds of intensive effort ten seconds of rest repeat eight times promises that it is possible to be fit with just minutes of training a week tabata remembers the first time he tested his training system on his university students in the early s after four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted they were almost dead but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised we all were surprised tabata created his training programme after he watched japans speed skating team in the early s he saw that short bursts of very hard exercise were as effective as hours of normal exercise tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment one group of students did an hour of cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week the other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike then four minutes of tabata training four times a week plus one minute session of exercise with two minutes of tabata the results were very surprising after six weeks of testing the group who did tabatas plan exercising for just minutes a week increased their anaerobic capacity by and their vo max by the other group who trained for five hours every week also improved their vo max but only by but their training had no effect on their anaerobic capacity but you have to work very very hard you cant sit on a machine chewing gum and reading hello magazine you have to do intensive bursts of activity on an exercise bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints and so on remember how you felt after doing a m sprint at school imagine doing eight sprints with only a tensecond break between them full effort at of your vo max is the basis of the programme says tabata if you feel ok afterwards youve not done it properly the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossible in the original plan we wanted eight repetitions but some people could only do six or seven one person on an online forum wrote most people cannot do it correctly and they shouldnt even try tabata doesnt completely agree everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they dont work too hard he explains he also says that his programme burns an extra calories in the hours after exercise most people use it to get fit or to get even fitter but the programme also burns fat so its a little surprising that at the moment only serious athletes are doing the programme this may change because tabata says there will soon be tabata instructors and a series of dvds at the end of the year i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and some people are doing it wrong because they dont understand how hard they need to work says tabata so should we all start using tabata in our fitness programmes richard scrivener a former rugby fitness coach says that you should not stop your usual training tabata training is something extra runners for example need to run a lot of miles in their training he says but they could do fewer long runs by introducing tabata training this will give their bodies the chance to rest and recover especially if they have injuries gym fans can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions but we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort thats the programme it is hard but it worksn,ele,Exercise
fit in four minutes sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on latenight satellite tv then you try dr izumi tabatas training programme seconds of allout effort ten seconds of rest repeat eight times and after collapsing on the floor you realize you were wrongn tabata has seen it all before they were dead he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early s after four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised we all weren he began his research after he watched japans speed skating team in the early s he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment one group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week the other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike followed by four minutes of tabata training four times a week plus one minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of tabatan the results were very surprising after six weeks of testing the group following tabatas plan exercising for just minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by and their vo max something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power by the control group who trained for five hours every week also improved their vo max but by and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacitywe also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises says tabatan but you have to work very very hard you cant sit on a cross trainer chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello the programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints and so on remember how you felt after doing a m sprint at school imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recovern allout effort at of your vo max is the basis of the programme says tabata if you feel ok afterwards youve not done it properly the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard in the original plan the aim was to get to eight but some only managed six or sevenn one person on an online forum wrote when done correctly you should meet god most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldnt even try tabata doesnt completely agree everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them he explains he adds that his programme burns an extra calories in the hours after exercise even at rest so although it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fatn its slightly surprising therefore that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment but that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and while i am pleased that people are doing it some are doing it wrong because they dont realize how hard they need to work says tabatan so should we all start following this plan richard scrivener a former rugby fitness coach says that while the benefits are clear tabatas are an addition not a replacement to a favoured sport or training method runners for instance need a high level of running economy which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles says scrivener but they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing tabata training this will give joints the chance to rest and recover especially if you have a history of injuries and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do themn gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort thats the cruel genius of the programme it is hard and effectiven n,in,Exercise
