scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the welldocumented phenomenon whereby people remember events or experiences that have never happened false memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law defendants have often been convicted of offences based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions later overturned when dna or some other corroborating evidence is brought to bear in order to study how these false memories might form in the human brain susumu tonagawa a neuroscientist at the massachusetts institute of technology mit and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements including records of objects space and time these records called engrams are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them according to tonagawa both false and genuinememories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms in their work tonagawas team used a technique known as optogenetics which allows the fine control of individual brain cells they engineered brain cells in the mouse hippocampus a part of the brain known to be involved in forming memories to express the gene for a protein called channelrhodopsin when cells that contain channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light they become activated the researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in whichever brain cells the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams in the experiment tonagawas team placed the mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore it as they did so relevant memoryencoding brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin protein the next day the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock to encode a fear response at the same time the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber that way the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber in the final part of the experiment the team placed the mice back in the first chamber the mice froze demonstrating a typical fear response even though they had never been shocked while there we call this incepting or implanting false memories in a mouse brain tonagawa told science a similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans humans are very imaginative animals said tonagawa independent of what is happening around you in the outside world humans constantly have internal activity in the brain so just like our mouse it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good highvariance ongoing events in other words there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you he added our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar almost identical brain mechanisms it is difficult for the false memory bearer to distinguish between them we hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be chris french head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at goldsmiths university of london is a leading researcher in false memories in people he said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not as is often assumed work like a video camera faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience instead it is a reconstructive process which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event but also possibly including information from other sources he cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry for example false memories of childhood sexual abuse or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse abduction by aliens or past lives such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level said professor french mark stokes a neuroscientist at oxford university said the experiments were a tour de force but that it was important to put them into perspective although the results seem to imply that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation rather than the actual environment this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most peoples idea of memory he said rather he said it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them wary of a specific environment for no apparent reason it is unlikely that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories although it is possible that over time such pairing could be integrated with other memories to construct a more elaborate false narrative the mouse models created by the mit team will help scientists ask ever more complex questions about memories in people now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy said steve ramirez a colleague of tonagawas at mit are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories can false memories be artificially created what about false memories for more than just contexts false memories for objects food or other mice these are the once seemingly scifi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab as the technology develops said french scientists need to think about its uses carefully whatever means are used to implant false memories we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated n,adv,False memory

staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs without their contribution the history of this great club would not be as rich in my early years the backing of the board and sir bobby charlton in particular gave me the confidence and time to build a football club rather than just a football team over the past decade the glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage manchester united to the best of my ability and i have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in david gill i am truly grateful to all of them to the fans thank you the support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling it has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and i have treasured my time as manager of manchester united the sudden nature of fergusons departure is in keeping with how the scot stated he would leave the post after he mentioned a first retirement during the season before performing a uturn it is understood he gathered the players in the firstteam changing room shortly after they arrived for training on wednesday morning in an emotional speech he announced he was to step down he then took his backroom staff aside before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen joel glazer joint owner of manchester united said alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but hes also a wonderful person his determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable i will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us like that magical night in moscow avie glazer his brother said i am delighted to announce that alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director his contributions to manchester united over the last years have been extraordinary and like all united fans i want him to be a part of its future david gill the outgoing chief executive said ive had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with alex for unforgettable years through the treble the double countless trophy wins and numerous signings we knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in firstclass condition alexs vision energy and ability have built teams both on and off the pitch that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport the way he cares for this club his staff and for the football family in general is something that i admire it is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that i have been privileged to witness in the last years what he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten it has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend firstteam coach ren meulensteen revealed how ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on wednesday morning i found out this morning when i came to the club he said he called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken its always been on the cards theres speculation every season i think the manager kept his cards close to his chest i think he felt the time was right now and he made a decision hes obviously a man who thinks very very hard so im sure hes put a lot of thought into making this decision i wish him well hes been fantastic for this club and i hope all the fans give whoevers going

junior smart knows a lot about gangs he is now and his life can be divided into two distinct phases he tells how in his late teens after his mother died he became drawn into a south london gang which at the time helped fill a huge vacuum they became my new support group he says at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious more and more about making money they got involved in criminality that is how it was at school smart failed his gcses then retook them at college and passed the lot he secured a fulltime job in administration and worked as a dj but on the side he was making money illegally as part of the gang eventually he was arrested for serious drugrelated offences and was sent to prison for years instantly he says his sense of invincibility was shattered the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wakeup call of my life he says i had been living a dual life i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers enemies i spent a long time sorting myself out today junior smart runs a team of fulltime workers and six volunteers which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime most of those working there are like smart himself exoffenders a few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help they work with the police the probation service and other voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across london for smart the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed from within a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates he recalls a drug addict he befriended who to his dismay kept returning i was touched by the people who kept coming back in he says i couldnt believe that nothing was being done about it i was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the index offence one guy had a aweek cocaine habit which he funded through burglary he would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house even when he knew people were there so although he had a drug addiction it never got dealt with the thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door that case and scores of others persuaded smart to start working as a prison listener an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside from there he developed what he calls his own little plan to run his own scheme once out of prison using the experience of exoffenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life he was released early after five years at the end of my sentence i got an opportunity to put my little model into practice he says so what does he think now does he believe that after the riots of last august and the governments promise to crack down on gangs things are getting better he is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good but overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that once the leader of a gang is arrested the problem is solved he agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang he draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad when you arrest the top guy people start fighting for position all the way up who was the most loyal who had the most respect it is a bit like a family they are more likely to act out through violence it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a longterm effect they have not even given the community a respite can it actually make the streets more dangerous it can do because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent creating new lower levels all the way down people take sides if one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder leader has been taken out then they suddenly think that gangs weak and so we have interestate disputes going on and what happens when that elder is in prison he forms alliances with other gang members or when he gets released he then tries to retake control that is when violence happens in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools the youngest members are called tinies over the last years we have seen more and more of this the tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old the young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk it is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing he says smart says that with a lack of government funding and commitment to longterm rehabilitation the challenges are immense particularly in the current economic climate i try to engage a young person who has been earning a week through illegal methods it was hard before to try to convince him but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits it makes things tougher that said his project which has well over clients is delivering results fewer than of those who come in for help reoffend from personal experience smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on i dont think that about anybody he saysn,adv,Gangs

throughout a momentous day at liverpools anglican cathedral for the families of the people who died so needlessly at sheffield wednesdays hillsborough football ground one phrase dominated above all else the truth these were the words most infamously abused by a headline in the sun newspaper above stories which we now know in extraordinarily shocking detail were fed by the south yorkshire police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims margaret aspinall whose son james then died at what should have been a joyful day out an fa cup semifinal between liverpool and nottingham forest said the families had been forced to fight for years for just that the truth aspinall chair of the hillsborough family support group said that although the families loss would never fade she was delighted at the unequivocal profound apology given for hillsboroughs savage failings by david cameron the hillsborough independent panel had inspected documents generated by the police sheffield wednesday and all other bodies responsible and delivered its remarkable page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters some of what happened to cause the disaster and the polices subsequent blameshifting has been exposed before but the depth of what the families call a coverup in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters was still startling in a concerted campaign led the panel found by the chief constable peter wright the south yorkshire police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster the victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels this was an exceptional decision the panel said for which it found no rationale when victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records the report substantially authored by professor phil scraton of queens university belfast and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts found there was no evidence to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness ticketlessness or violence among liverpool fans the report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims wright was meeting his police federation in a sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a rock solid story the secretary of the south yorkshire police federation branch constable paul middup told the restaurant meeting before wright turned up the chief constable had said the truth could not come from him but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him as had many senior officers the meeting was held just four days after the disaster it was the day that the sun splashed its headline the truth over lies fed to it by four senior south yorkshire police officers middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and to get the message togetherness across to the force the panels report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers statements by senior south yorkshire police officers amounted to a black propaganda unit the officers statements presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day and largely emphasize misbehaviour by supporters the panel found that of statements were amended to remove or alter comments unfavourable to south yorkshire police the police had claimed this was done only to remove conjecture and opinion from the statements but the panel had no doubt the operation to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts went further it was done to remove criticism of the police scraton said this propaganda did not convince the original inquiry which ruled as quickly as august that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false and criticized the police for making the claims the report revealed that sheffield wednesdays football ground was unsafe in crucial respects that the football association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if hillsborough had a valid safety certificate which it did not in that landscape of neglect it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police commanded by an inexperienced chief superintendent david duckenfield that was the prime cause of the disaster the police lost control outside the ground where liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just turnstiles so duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in his blunder of the first magnitude according to the inquiry was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the leppings lane terrace the inquiry report established this but the police undaunted repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest its procedure was marked by the coroners decision not to take evidence of what happened after pm on the day of the disaster thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic the finding that of the who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and aspinall said difficult for the families to contemplate in the light of the panels report the attorney general will now consider whether to apply to the high court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held there may be prosecutions too after all these years of sheffield wednesday south yorkshire police and sheffield city council which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground trevor hicks the president of the hfsg both of whose teenage daughters sarah and victoria died in the crush said the truth is out today

ninetysix people died at sheffield wednesdays hillsborough stadium in during an extraordinary day years later at liverpool cathedral where the families of the victims met to see a report on the disaster the most important words were the truth this was the headline in the sun newspaper we now know that the story in the newspaper was false and that the police gave them the story margaret aspinalls son james then died at the match between liverpool and nottingham forest she said the families had to fight for years for the truth she said that the families sadness will never go away but she is very pleased that the prime minister said sorry for hillsborough an independent panel looked at documents written by the police sheffield wednesday and all the other groups involved the panel then wrote a page report in the report they criticize official mistakes and say that the victims and other fans were not to blame we already knew the cause of the disaster but we didnt know that the police coverup was so big it is shocking how the police blamed the football fans for the disaster the panel found that the south yorkshire police led by the chief constable peter wright told their story that drunken fans or those without tickets caused the disaster they tested the victims blood for alcohol when victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records the police said that many liverpool fans were very drunk were without tickets and were very violent but the report found no evidence for this the report said that wright met with police in a sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a story the meeting happened just four days after the disaster it was the day that the sun newspaper published its headline the truth and the story by four senior south yorkshire police officersn the panel found that officers statements were changed to remove criticism of the police and emphasize bad behaviour by fans the panel found that of statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about south yorkshire police the police said this was done only to remove opinion from the statements but the panel said they did more than that it was done to remove criticism of the police the report said the original inquiry did not believe this propaganda it decided in august that the police stories of fan drunkenness and violence were false and it criticized the police for telling lies it said that sheffield wednesdays stadium was unsafe that the football association chose that stadium for the match without even checking if it had a safety certificate it did not have a certificate but the main cause of the disaster was the way the police controlled the crowd the police lost control outside the stadium where liverpool fans had to go through just small entrance gates so police opened a large exit gate and lots of people were allowed in they did not close one of the tunnels and the inquiry said this was their big mistake but the police still repeated their lies at the inquest the coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after pm on the day of the disaster so he did not look at the chaotic behaviour of the police and the ambulance service the panel found that if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs better they could have saved of the lives lost there may now be a new inquest there may be prosecutions too after all these years of sheffield wednesday south yorkshire police and sheffield city council which was responsible for the safety of the stadium trevor hicks whose two daughters died in the disaster said the truth is out today hicks said tomorrow is for justicen,ele,Hillsborough

the problem with google glasses says takahito iguchi is that theyre not cool he has a point theres already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or more often both it possibly wasnt googles smartest move to release the first pairs to software developers rather than say supermodels or scarlett johansson search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large naked man wearing them in the shower and its this that iguchi a japanese entrepreneur hopes may be googles achilles heel he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylized a bit more blade runner a bit more japanese iguchis augmented reality glasses which arent really glasses so much as a single piece of metal with a camera and a microprojector are called telepathy one and after unveiling them at the south by southwest festival in austin texas they have attracted m of venture capital like glass telepathy one is due to launch in its a strippeddown simplified version of google glass whereas glass is he says an egotistical device with a range of uses you can surf the net read emails take photographs do unspecified things with as yet unspecified apps telepathy will be more of a communication device connected via bluetooth to your phone it will focus on real time visual and audio sharing youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email or see and speak to a floating video image of a friend it will help bring you close to your friends and family we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities says iguchi who has worked in the japanese tech industry for years most recently developing a locationbased phone app called sekai camera of course not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset i point out iguchi shakes his head im a visionary i have a dream that people will understand other people when i go to london i am a stranger sometimes i feel fear but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other and with this device you can know more information about people before you even speak to them compared to the likes of google of course telepathy is a minnow not that this seems to daunt takahito iguchi in his shared office space in san francisco a cool converted warehouse in the heart of startup land filled with twentysomethings he quotes sun tzus the art of war and points out that even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty forces when he was growing up japanese technology ruled the world the sony walkman was the iphone of its day now to compete hes had to quit tokyo for silicon valley tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but its still an island its isolated there is not any way to expand whereas in silicon valley everyone is from everywhere its where you come to connect globally the hardware will be made in japan while he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications on the day i meet him hes being shadowed by a news crew from japan who are interested in the new wave of japanese entrepreneurs being forced to leave their homeland we are losing our confidence the correspondent takashi yanagisawa tells me and we need to find a way to regain our power iguchi is kind of like the new frontier we hope he might be a new solution building the prototype of telepathy one was easy iguchi says we have every sort of technology in tokyo it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge the leading manufacturers are lining up to work with him he says because they have the technology they just struggle to sell it there needs to be a story to the product like apple did with the ipod songs in your pocket and the way they positioned themselves against microsoft and ibm it was like the story of david and goliath and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita the cofounder of sony and he inspired me so maybe it will come in a circle maybe he certainly has the confidence of jobs although with a thick japanese accent he sometimes struggles to make himself understood a fact that may have contributed to telepathy ones conception when he went to london to present the headset at the prestigious founders forum he stayed in an airbnb the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours and now he is my friend that is how long it takes to understand each other to share our feelings and background and career maybe telepathy makes that shorter if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks that will happen more easily and this man is involved in getting investment from uk to africa and he was very excited about telepathy that it would be a way of educating people about africa of showing them other peoples point of view this is iguchis fondest hope that seeing somebody elses literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view as a student he explains he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night and one day i opened the door of my apartment and i suddenly realized that everything is code that was my enlightenment everything is coded and is shareable between humans and everything can be encoded and decoded and if code is exchangeable between humans that will end all war against each other n,adv,Japan

back in the old city in srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour a stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent kashmir it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than people dead buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous northindian region how quickly things change now carefree tourists line up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh the nowhatta mosque where in the summer of youths would gather after friday prayers to throw stones at the security forces is to become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage crafts and markets down by dal lake houseboats have been booked out months in advance in the stunning gardens lining the lakes green slopes visitors can have their picture taken against one of asias prettiest backdrops until the snow melted the nearby ski resorts were packed with rich russians too in only just over tourists dared to visit the kashmir valley frightened off by the antiindian insurgency which has claimed up to lives so far in the area has received almost one million holidaymakers more than of them from outside india but fewer than britons were among them largely because the uks foreign office refuses to amend its somewhat hairraising advice which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region omar abdullah the ukborn chief minister of jammu and kashmir has lobbied the british high commission in delhi to relax the guidelines but to no avail its a source of frustration admitted abdullah who has been in charge of indias most sensitive state since the start of today unfortunately as a result of that travel advisory peoples insurance is null and void when they visit here the last publicized case of foreign tourists being murdered in jk was in when six westerners including two britons were kidnapped by alfaran a kashmiri militant islamist group only one escaped with his life youve had british citizens killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting i mean how many british citizens did you lose in did you stop people from visiting new york youve lost them in spain in bali tell me where you havent lost them said abdullah weve lost indians in london there is still a possibility that alqaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past but we havent stopped indians from travelling to london there is no reason to single out jammu and kashmir or even srinagar as an unsafe destination germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes counselled germanys amended advice at the time it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move coming less than a year after the disturbances finally died down a nationwide holiday on august marked years of indian independence in the past a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the worlds biggest democracy but this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would in other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the indian and pakistani controlled parts of jk syed ali shah geelani leader of the prokashmiri independence party disagrees bitterly with much of abdullahs politics but on the issue of tourism the two are united at the start of the summer season geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims that said whatever your faith whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong we are bound by a common bond the bond of humanity you are our honoured guest respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems but all the locals we spoke to in srinagar were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism amjid gulzar said abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors he must do both but without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year kashmir had to do more to attract bigspending visitors especially foreigners we need better infrastructure better roads reliable electricity we need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city and there isnt enough for tourists to do after dark he said but will tourists feel welcome in june a local islamic group issued a dress code for foreign tourists abdullah sighs at the mention of that furore nobody expects tourists to come here and cover their faces i think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention i think the basic point they were making was be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately i think thats common sense abdullah said he was on a tourism drive for no other reason than the fact that i need to stimulate the econom jks finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil the state receives just m each year in taxes and yet the salary bill for the public employees is m he said it is clear why he needs to find more funds fast for now though he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back im not suggesting that because weve

ever since he was diagnosed hiv positive moses king has had one major problem he has been able to cope with the stigma of being hiv positive widespread in liberia and he was able to access antiretroviral medication provided by the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and distributed by the liberian government but king and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat a subsistence farmer he grew vegetables and bought rice but meat and fish expensive luxury products in liberian markets but essential sources of protein remained elusive subsistence farming allowed us to survive but we had so many problems said king we could not get any protein and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves pate k chon a counsellor who works with hiv sufferers in liberia provided an unlikely solution since watching a documentary about a fish farm in thailand several years earlier she had thought of setting up a similar project in liberia enabling hiv sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein i saw this film about fish in a cement pool and i thought it was a good idea said chon herself diagnosed with hiv in so many of the people i work with dont have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein it doesnt cause health problems like other sources and it is something we can farm chon founder of a faithbased ngo began building a pool in which to farm fish in june chon met john sheehy a strategic philanthropist and founder of consultancy emerging business lab who raised money for the nonprofit fish farm in the northeast of monrovia liberias capital and set about learning aquaculture doing an online course through cornell university and speaking to other fish farmers in africa i raised the money and built the farm learned the proper tank layout and water flow system said sheehy a lot of my knowledge was selftaught and now i would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people he added the project has now grown into the growfeed liberia fish farm with tanks which when fully stocked will each have fish providing up to fish per year serving a community of predominantly hivpositive people including king and his family in addition to the fish waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops also providing food and income for the community made up of women men and children the members of the community live near the farm and have agreed to be part of the cooperative said sheehy many work on the farm or tending the crops and what they get in return when the fish are fully grown after days is fish they can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items the fish farm gives these people with hiv a way of getting back into society now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week according to liberias demographic health survey of liberias million people are hiv positive with of those women or girls stigma and discrimination still surround the illness and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated good nutrition is particularly important for people with hiv research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs said chon the drugs are toxic and if you dont have food to eat they can make you very ill but food in liberia is very expensive we buy expensive imported rice even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford sheehy says growfeed is the first cooperative fish farm in liberia to operate for the benefit of an hivpositive community the project has attracted the interest of the liberian government and the un food and agriculture organization which has worked with growfeed to provide training will also support teaching at the university of liberia fish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in africa fish farming is absolutely viable in africa said paul white owner of the hydrofish fish farm in ivory coast which produces tonnes of fish each year a lot of the fish on the market comes from china and is imported frozen it is of a quality that could never enter europe or america there has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of knowhow in fish production it is all coming to the forefront now he added some critics are sceptical of farmed fish citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins but sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems a lot of farmed fish is inbred which does cause problems but we are using a process with local fish sourced in liberia not fish from another region said sheehy that means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock and we are not using lakes that are cornered off where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake we can control the environment using the tanks and we test the water and monitor it constantly sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout liberia and the region a ricegrowing coop in sierra leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from nigeria and central america said sheehy but we operate nonprofit and we will never lose our social justice aspect n,adv,Liberia

police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost years relied on lie detectors to help convict criminals or unearth spies and traitors the polygraph is beloved of the movies with countless dramatic moments showing the guilty sweating profusely as they are hooked up but the invention could soon be defunct researchers in britain and the netherlands have made a breakthrough developing a method with a success rate in tests of over that could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade rather than relying on facial tics talking too much or waving of arms all seen as telltale signs of lying the new method involves monitoring fullbody motions to provide an indicator of signs of guilty feelings the polygraph is widely used in the us in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the fbi and cia but is much less popular in europe there has been a lot of scepticism in the scientific and legal communities about its reliability by contrast the new method developed by the researchers has performed well in experiments the basic premise is that liars fidget more and so the use of an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will pick this up the suit contains sensors that register movement up to times per second in three dimensions for joints one of the research team ross anderson professor of security engineering at cambridge university said decades of deception research show that the interviewer will tell truth from lies only slightly better than random about out of the polygraph has been around since the s and by measuring physiological stress induced by anxiety you can get to however it can easily be abused as an interrogation prop and many people are anxious anyway facing a polygraph on which their job or liberty depends he said the new method by contrast achieved a reliability rating of over and he was confident they would be able to do better in some tests the team has already achieved more than anderson said the takeaway message is that guilty people fidget more and we can measure this robustly anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time against the background of the us senate report on torture by the cia apart from the moral case against torture anderson pointed out that it was a very unreliable way of gathering accurate information we have known for a long time that torture does not work he said the new method offers a pragmatic scientifically backed alternative to conducting interviews the research paper was written by dr sophie van der zee of cambridge university professor ronald poppe of utrecht university professor paul taylor of lancaster university and anderson the polygraph was created in by policeman john larson based on research by the psychologist william marston it records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying while cinema depictions suggest the device is nearinfallible the us supreme court ruled in that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable a finding supported by the us national academy of scientists in the experiment carried out by anderson and his colleagues involved students and employees at lancaster university of which half were told to tell the truth and half to lie they were each paid for their participation in the minute experiment involving two tests some were interviewed about a computer game never end which they played for seven minutes while others lied about playing it having only been shown notes about it the second test involved a lost wallet containing some were asked to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box while others hid it and lied about it overall we correctly classified truths lies of the interviewees as either being truthful or deceptive based on the combined movement in their individual limbs the report says anderson said our first attempt looked at the extent to which different body parts and body signals indicated deception it turned out that liars wave their arms more but again this is only at the level that you can get from a conventional polygraph the pay dirt was when we considered total body motion that turns out to tell truth from lies over of the time and we believe it can be improved still further by combining it with optimal questioning techniques another advantage is that total body motion is relatively unaffected by cultural background anxiety and cognitive load how much you are thinking which confound other liedetection technologies anderson said the use of allbody suits is expensive they cost about and can be uncomfortable and anderson and his colleagues are now looking at lowcost alternatives these include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the kinect devices developed by microsoft for the xbox console anderson acknowledges that agencies such as the cia could teach agents how to counter the fullbody motion method by freezing their bodies but he said that in itself would be a giveaway n,adv,Lie detector
police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost years used the polygraph a liedetector test to help catch criminals and spies but now researchers in britain and the netherlands have developed a new method which is correct in tests over of the time police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years it doesnt monitor movements in the face talking too much or waving arms all signs that someone is lying the new method monitors movements in the whole body which can show that the person is feeling guilty the polygraph is often used in the us in criminal cases and by the fbi and cia but is much less popular in europe many people do not believe that it is reliable the basic idea behind the new method is that liars fidget more and that an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will record this the new method is over reliable the polygraph is only reliable in some tests the success rate of the new method was more than ross anderson one of the research team said guilty people fidget more and we can now measure this the polygraph was created in by policeman john larson it records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to find out if someone is lying in movies the polygraph is always correct but in the us supreme court decided that there was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable the us national academy of scientists said the same thing in the tests anderson and his colleagues did involved students and employees at lancaster university half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie the researchers interviewed some of the people about a computer game called never end that they played for seven minutes others lied about playing it the second test involved a lost wallet with inside some people had to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box others hid it and lied about it the new bodysuit method was correct of the time researchers monitored how much the people moved their arms and legs to decide if they were telling the truth or lying allbody suits are expensive they cost about and they can be uncomfortable so anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives these include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the kinect devices developed by microsoft for the xbox consolen,ele,Lie detector

a few months before he died carl sagan recorded a message of hope to wouldbe mars explorers telling them whatever the reason youre on mars is im glad youre there and i wish i was with you seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer set out his hopeful vision of the future in a company from the netherlands is proposing to turn sagans dreams of reaching mars into reality the company mars one plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the red planet to set up a human colony in but there are a couple of serious snags firstly when on mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is of that on earth it is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in earths conditions secondly and directly related to the first they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends as the deal doesnt include a return ticket the mars one website states that a return cannot be anticipated nor expected to return they would need a fully assembled and fuelled rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field of mars onboard life support systems capable of up to a sevenmonth voyage and the capacity either to dock with a space station orbiting earth or perform a safe reentry and landing not one of these is a small endeavour the site notes requiring substantial technical capacity weight and cost nevertheless the project has already had applicants according to the companys medical director norbert kraft he told the guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from to at least and though they include women they tended to be men the reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied he said an american woman called cynthia who gave her age as told the company that it was a childhood imagining of hers to go to mars she described a trip her mother had taken her on in the early s to a lecture at the university of wisconsin she said the lecturer had been sagan and she had asked him if he thought humans would land on mars in her lifetime cynthia said he in turn asked me if i wanted to be trapped in a tin can spacecraft for the two years it would take to get there i told him yes he smiled and told me in all seriousness that yes he absolutely believed that humans would reach mars in my lifetime she told the project when i first heard about the mars one project i thought this is my chance that childhood dream could become a reality i could be one of the pioneers building the first settlement on mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for the prime attributes mars one is looking for in astronautsettlers are resilience adaptability curiosity ability to trust and resourcefulness according to kraft they must also be over founded in by bas lansdorp an engineer mars one says it has developed a realistic road map and financing plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible the website states that the basic elements required for life are already present on the planet for instance water can be extracted from ice in the soil and mars has sources of nitrogen the primary element in the air we breathe the colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels it says mars one said it had signed a contract with the american firm paragon space development corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and spacesuits fit for the mission the project will cost a reported bn a sum lansdorp has said he hopes will be met partly by selling broadcasting rights the broadcasting revenue from the london olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to mars lansdorp said in an interview with abc news another ambassador to the project is paul rmer the cocreator of big brother one of the first and most successful reality tv shows on the website rmer gave an indication of how the broadcasting of the project might proceed this mission to mars could be the biggest media event in the world said rmer reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching the aim is to establish a permanent human colony according to the companys website the first team would land on the surface of mars in to begin constructing the colony with a team of four astronauts every two years after that the project is not without its sceptics however and concerns have been raised about how astronauts might get to the planet and establish a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed professor gerardt hooft winner of the nobel prize for theoretical physics in is an ambassador for the project t hooft admits there are unknown health risks the radiation is of quite a different nature from anything that has been tested on earth he said the mission hopes to inspire generations to believe that all things are possible that anything can be achieved much like the apollo moon landings mars one believes it is not only possible but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system the origins of life and of equal importance our place in the universe it says n,adv,Life on Mars

on the market square in rjukan stands a statue of the towns founder a noted norwegian engineer and industrialist called sam eyde the great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him behind him to the south rises the equally sheer metre peak known as gaustatoppen between the mountains along the narrow vestfjord valley lies the small but once mighty town that eyde built in the early years of the last century to house the workers for his factories eyde harnessed the power of the metre rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was at the time the worlds biggest power plant but one thing he couldnt do was change the elevation of the sun deep in its east west valley surrounded by high mountains rjukan and its inhabitants are in shadow for half the year during the day from late september to midmarch the town three hours northwest of oslo is not completely dark but its certainly not bright either recently however eydes statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling high on the mountain opposite metres above the town three large solarpowered computercontrolled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight its the sun grins ingrid sparbo disbelievingly lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes a retired secretary sparbo has lived all her life in rjukan and says people do sort of get used to the shade you end up not thinking about it really but this this is so warming not just physically but mentally its mentally warming two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun on a freezing day an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches smiling at the warmth on their faces children beam lots of people take photographs a shop assistant silje johansen says its awesome just awesome pushing his childs buggy electrical engineer eivind toreid is more cautious its a funny thing he says not real sunlight but very like it like a spotlight heidi fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio but its far more than i expected she says this will bring much happiness across the road in the nye tider caf sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness martin andersen is a yearold artist who moved to rjukan in the summer of the first inkling of an artwork andersen called the solspeil or sun mirror came to him as the month of september began to fade every day we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy he says and every day i realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun by september the sun completely disappears from rjukans market square it doesnt reappear until march throughout the seemingly endless intervening months andersen says wed look up and see blue sky above and the sun high on the mountain slopes but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town its sad a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun twelve years after he first dreamed of his solspeil a german company specializing in socalled csp concentrated solar power helicoptered in the three sqm glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in rjukan it took he says a bit longer than wed imagined it really works there were objectors and plenty of them petitions and letterwriting campaigns and a facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and above all a waste of money but even they now seem largely won over i was strongly against it admits nils eggerud like many others he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere on a couple of extra carers to look after rjukans old people perhaps or improved school facilities cycle paths a bit of rural road resurfacing and i still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs he says what will they be who will pay them but well it does feel nice standing here and really you just have to look at the peoples faces in his office overlooking the square rjukans energetic young mayor steinar bergsland is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town already bergsland says visitor numbers are up for the time of year and rjukans shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit a hitech company is interested in relocating to rjukan attracted by the cuttingedge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted this is a powerful symbol for rjukan bergsland says and helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business the town needed to find just m krone of the mirrors total mkrone cost and seen against the towns m krone annual budget he points out m krone really wasnt very much to pay for something that gives us a far far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care and just look out of the

the senate intelligence committee has approved a bill that would provide for increased transparency of the national security agencys bulk collection of us phone records but allow the controversial practice to continue sponsored by chairwoman dianne feinstein the bill lets the nsa continue to collect phone metadata of millions of americans for renewable day periods and allows the government to retain it some legislators have alternatively proposed letting phone companies hold the metadata it passed the committee by an vote paving the way for a full senate vote the bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect there is a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is associated with international terrorism additionally the bill allows the nsa to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the us if they enter the country for a transitory period not to exceed hours the bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by senator patrick leahy that would end domestic phonerecords collection it was also opposed by leading intelligence committee member mark udall who said it did not go far enough the nsas invasive surveillance of americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform not incidental changes unfortunately the bill passed by the senate intelligence committee does not go far enough to address the nsas overreaching domestic surveillance programmes udall said another democratic member of the committee ron wyden said the bill maintains business as usual and remains far from anything that could be considered meaningful reform feinstein defended the nsa bulk collection programme but said there was a need to rebuild public trust the nsa callrecords programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight and i believe it contributes to our national security she said in a statement but more can and should be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place in her statement feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and oversight on the nsa including requiring an annual public report of the total number of queries of nsas telephone metadata database and the number of times the programme leads to an fbi investigation or probable cause order requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance court impose limits on the number of people at nsa who may authorize or query the callrecords database establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa by the united states mandating the fisa court impose a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a query of bulk communication records after the committees hearing had ended feinstein strongly endorsed the nsas main domestic programme i think theres huge misunderstanding about this nsa database programme and how vital it is to protecting this country she told reporters concern over the intelligence committees bill was expressed by independent legal experts who said the stage was now set for a showdown with the usa freedom act a bill introduced by leahy and jim sensenbrenner that would prohibit bulk collection of americans telephone records elizabeth goitein of the brennan center for justice said the intelligence committee bill and the usa freedom act present two opposing visions of the relationship between lawabiding americans and the national security state the fundamental question is should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up americans most personal information to feed into its databases leahy and sensenbrenner say yes feinstein says no wyden suggested that recent concern about nsa spying on foreign leaders had distracted from the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the us the statements that american intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership thats consistent with the understanding ive had for years as a member of the intelligence committee he said that has implications for foreign policy my top priority is ending the mass surveillance digital surveillance of millions and millions of law abiding americans feinstein unexpectedly announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the nsa conducts of german chancellor angela merkel feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the nsas bulk collection of americans phone records americans are making it clear that they never repeat never agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security wyden said were just going to keep fighting this battle its going to be a long one separately feinstein said that james clapper the director of national intelligence had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a washington post story that alleged the nsa had intercepted data in transmission between google and yahoo data centres she said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw clappers rebuttal her strong endorsement of the domestic phone records collection indicates that the powerful senate democrat is not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the nsa that she has launched totally opposing its surveillance of foreign allied leaders a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance wyden would not comment on the washington post report on the google and yahoo intercepts but the senators suggested it had implications for the privacy of americans communication decades ago countries had their own kinds of communication systems now that youve had the merger of global communications i think youre going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for us citizens wyden said n,adv,NSA 2
the us senate intelligence committee recently agreed a bill to allow the national security agency nsa to continue to collect us phone records but it would also make the nsas activities more transparent the committee chairwoman dianne feinstein introduced the bill it allows the nsa to continue to collect the telephone metadata of millions of americans it also allows the government to keep the data eleven people voted for the bill and four people voted against it the full senate will now vote on the bill the bill allows analysts to search through the data if they believe that someone may be involved in international terrorism the bill also allows the nsa to continue to watch foreigners who come to the us if they enter the country for less than hours senator patrick leahy introduced another bill the usa freedom act this bill would stop the collection of phone records in the us feinstein defended the nsa phone data collection programme but said that people didnt trust the nsa anymore the nsa programme is legal and i believe it makes us safer she said but we can and should do more to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and checks on the nsa for example if the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa gets some data and then somebody looks at that data without permission they could spend up to ten years in prison feinstein says she strongly supports the nsas main us programme i think many people dont understand this nsa database programme it is very important and helps to protect this country she said independent legal experts said they were worried about the intelligence committees bill elizabeth goitein of the brennan center for justice said the intelligence committee bill and the usa freedom act are two opposing visions of the relationship between americans who do not break the law and the national security state the most important question is should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting americans most personal information leahy says yes feinstein says no democratic committee member ron wyden said that recent worries about nsa spying on foreign leaders took attention away from the more important problem of the nsa checking the data of people in the us my top priority is ending the collection of data on millions and millions of innocent americans feinstein said that she completely disagreed with the foreign leader spying that the nsa does for example on german chancellor angela merkel but feinstein agrees with the nsas collection of americans phone records americans are making it clear that they never repeat never agreed to give up their freedom so that the country could appear to be safer wyden said were just going to continue to fight this battle its going to be a long battlen,ele,NSA 2

the national security agency nsa has obtained direct access to the systems of google facebook apple and other us internet giants according to a topsecret document the nsa access is part of a previously undisclosed program called prism which allows officials to collect material including search history the content of emails file transfers and live chats the document says the guardian has verified the authenticity of the document a slide powerpoint presentation classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program the document claims collection directly from the servers of major us service providers although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program in a statement google said google cares deeply about the security of our users data we disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully from time to time people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems but google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of prism or of any similar scheme they said they would never have been involved in such a program if they are doing this they are doing it without our knowledge one said an apple spokesman said he had never heard of prism the nsa access was enabled by changes to us surveillance law introduced under president bush and renewed under obama in december the program facilitates extensive indepth surveillance on live communications and stored information the law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the us or those americans whose communications include people outside the us it also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the us being collected without warrants disclosure of the prism program follows a leak to the guardian on wednesday of a topsecret court order compelling telecoms provider verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of us customers the participation of the internet companies in prism will add to the debate about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services unlike the collection of those call records this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata some of the worlds largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the informationsharing program since its introduction in microsoft which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan your privacy is our priority was the first with collection beginning in december it was followed by yahoo in google facebook and paltalk in youtube in skype and aol in and finally apple which joined the program in the program is continuing to expand with other providers due to come online collectively the companies cover the vast majority of online email search video and communications networks the extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users communications under us law but the prism program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers the nsa document notes the operations have the assistance of communications providers in the us the revelation also supports concerns raised by several us senators during the renewal of the fisa amendments act faa in december who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces when the faa was first enacted defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the nsas inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data but the prism program renders that consent unnecessary as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies servers a chart prepared by the nsa contained within the topsecret document highlights the breadth of the data it is able to obtain email video and voice chat videos photos voiceoverip skype for example chats file transfers social networking details and more the document is recent dating to april such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the nsa which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy the prism program allows the nsa the worlds largest surveillance organization to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders with this program the nsa is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications and perform realtime collection on targeted users a senior administration official said in a statement the guardian and washington post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa this law does not allow the targeting of any us citizen or of any person located within the united states the program is subject to oversight by the foreign intelligence surveillance court the executive branch and congress it involves extensive procedures specifically approved by the court to ensure that only nonus persons outside the us are targeted and that minimize the acquisition retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about us persons this program was recently reauthorized by congress after extensive hearings and debate information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats n,adv,NSA scandal

barack obama flew back to washington and his desk in the oval office on wednesday hours after delivering an election victory speech in chicago in which he called for the country to unite behind him you voted for action not politics as usual obama said in his address but there was little sign that his call would be answered with the president facing the prospect of doing business with a hostile republicanled house of representatives for at least another two years and a looming showdown over spending and debt the socalled fiscal cliff unlike after his election in the president is unlikely to be given a honeymoon period both the republican house speaker john boehner and the democratic leader in the senate harry reid spoke about a need to work together to resolve the crisis but it could turn into one of the biggest clashes yet between the white house and congress under obamas presidency while obama easily beat off the challenge from his republican opponent mitt romney holding swing state after swing state the election provided yet another reminder of just how divided america remains while the inauguration is not until january in effect obama embarked on his second term on wednesday having disappointed many supporters in his first term he is looking now to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one as well as overseeing what he hopes will be continued economic recovery he hopes to address issues ranging from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change and in foreign policy from iran to israelpalestine as well as comfortably winning more than the required electoral college votes he also secured a higher share of the popular vote boehner in a statement sounded conciliatory he cited the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs which is critical to solving our debt obama is reported to have phoned boehner to begin negotiation reid so often at odds with boehner also sounded conciliatory saying i look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and i reach out to my republican colleagues in the senate and the house lets come together we know what the issues are lets solve them obama in an initially offtherecord interview during the campaign expressed optimism of a grand bargain with the republicans one that eluded him in the trouble will come when talks move to detail with the republicans wanting to protect military spending while the democrats seek cuts obama has called for tax increases on households earning more than boehner has rejected any tax increases shares dropped on the dow in anticipation of continued gridlock by lunchtime all the major us markets were down over points the new house which will be formed in january will look much like the existing one which has a huge republican majority the senate too remained little changed with the democrats retaining their slim majority gaining three and losing one in the presidential race romney won only one of the swing states north carolina while obama held new hampshire virginia ohio wisconsin nevada iowa and colorado in his victory speech in chicago obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform he returned to the soaring rhetoric that was his trademark during the election but which he dispensed with in amid the disillusionment with his presidency and the tough economic conditions his campaign team decided it was inappropriate but having won he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches reprising once again his slogan about hope stepping up to the lectern to the upbeat sounds of stevie wonders signed sealed delivered im yours obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters tonight in this election you the american people reminded us that while our road has been hard while our journey has been long we have picked ourselves up we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the united states of america the best is yet to come in a speech that lasted more than minutes after paying emotional tribute to his wife michelle and his daughters malia and sasha as well as to his vicepresident joe biden obama returned to the message that first brought him to national attention we are not as divided as our politics suggests he said were not as cynical as the pundits believe we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states we are and forever will be the united states of america obama made clear he had an agenda in mind for his second term citing changes in the tax code immigration reform and as he put it an america that isnt threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet shortly beforehand romney had phoned the president to concede in a gracious concession speech in boston romney told his supporters the nation as you know is at a critical point at a time like this we cant risk partisan bickering and political posturing our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the peoples work he continued this is a time for great challenges for america and i pray the president will be successful in guiding our nation the campaign almost throughout has been a referendum on obama although there was widespread disillusionment with the slow pace of economy recovery and a high unemployment level americans decided to stick with him historically it would have been a disappointment for african americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended

wales will become the first country in the uk where people will be presumed to have consented for their organs to be donated unless they opt out the welsh assembly has voted to adopt the optout policy which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection the final stage of a bill to adopt a system of presumed consent was passed by votes to eight with two abstentions in spite of objections from religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the scheme could add to the distress of grieving families this is a huge day for wales for devolution and most importantly for the people in wales waiting for an organ transplant said the welsh health minister mark drakeford i am proud that wales will be the first nation in the uk to take this step as a society we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved ones wishes the family of the potential donor has a major role to play in organ donation the aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased however relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased when family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted they usually agree to participate in the donation process the new law will work by clarifying peoples wishes around the issue of organ donation and in turn increase the rate of consent to donation today is a landmark day for wales and i expect the rest of the uk to be watching with great interest when the legislation is implemented in the issue is controversial with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled but ministers insist there will be safeguards inevitably some people will not get around to registering their opposition in response to concerns the government recently announced that families would play a bigger role relatives are to have a clear right of objection giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs we have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them said drakeford about one person every week dies in wales while on a waiting list we have been working to improve the rate of organ donation and have had some success but were looking to take the next step forward around a third of the welsh population is on the organ donor register but well over two thirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors that other third is people who dont get round to putting their names down were hoping to make inroads into that the new law would apply to anybody over who has lived in wales for at least the year before his or her death donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in wales but to anybody in the uk doctors are delighted at the move the british medical association has long campaigned for an optout system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants a result of medical progress in transplantation the number of young donors dropped substantially when seatbelt legislation came in big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card with a good deal of success hospitals have also brought in improved systems for coordinating transplants including the crucial discussions with relatives when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased but the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough some religious groups on the other hand strongly oppose the scheme arguing that it would cause further distress to bereaved relatives members of the muslim council of wales and the south wales jewish representative council have expressed reservations while the archbishop of wales barry morgan said that donation ought to be a gift of love of generosity if organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection thats not an expression of love its more a medical use of a body n,adv,Organs

not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university there were cheers when richard buckley lead archaeologist on the hunt for the kings body finally announced that the university team was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it had found the last plantagenet king bent by scoliosis of the spine and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church which was slightly too small to hold his body but by then it was clear the evidence was overwhelming as the scientists who carried out the dna tests those who created the computerimaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the kings death and burial outlined their findings what a morning what a story said philippa langley of the richard iii society she had been driving on the project for years in the face of incredulity from many people and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral only yards from the excavation site and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there probably next year leicesters museums service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site richard died at bosworth on august the last english king to fall in battle and the researchers revealed how for the first time there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow believed to be from a halberd a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razorsharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos mounted on a wooden pole which was swung at richard at very close range the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and said the human bones expert jo appleby he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse another sword slash which also went through the bone and into the brain would also have proved fatal but many of the other injuries were after death suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the kings body was brought back to leicester as he was stripped mocked and mutilated one terrible injury a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse mocked and abused all the way is true bob savage a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried michael ibsen the canadianborn furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richards sister heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news he said many many hundreds of people died on that field that day he was a king but just one of the dead he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body in the first hour of the first day of the excavation he did not believe he had found the king the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave probably still naked but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again ten days later on september when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot he returned with lin foxhall head of the archaeology department to excavate the body we did it the usual way lifting the arms legs and skull first and proceeding gradually towards the torso so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought my word i think weve got him as far as langley is concerned richard was the true king the last king of the north a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history in the hands of the tudors image maker shakespeare there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower an infamous story even in richards day the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again although it is by no means certain that the

standing at the edge of space above the deserts of new mexico felix baumgartner paused slightly it was a small step away from the capsule but a mile drop back down to earth our guardian angel will take care of you said mission control and the man known as fearless felix jumped ten heartstopping minutes later the austrian landed back on earth after reaching speeds of up to mph and breaking three world records including becoming the worlds first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at mach we love you felix cheered the control room as his mother ava baumgartner wept baumgartner who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team he was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to earth without it his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded baumgartner later told a press conference when i was standing there on top of the world you become so humble you dont think about breaking records he admitted all he could think about was getting back alive but added sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are after two aborted attempts the week before the mission was given the goahead on sunday morning with the cooperation of the weather baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon which measured million square cubic feet and whose skin was onetenth the thickness of a sandwich bag at the bottom of the balloon was a capsule in which baumgartner sat in his suit as he reached the desired height baumgartner went through a checklist of items with his mentor joe kittinger the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight there was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working causing his visor to fog this is very serious joe he told kitttinger sometimes its getting foggy when i exhale i do not feel heat but they decided to go ahead watched by a record million people as the jump was streamed live on youtube the twoandahalfhour journey upwards during which the curvature of the earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black was matched with a rather more rapid descent three cameras attached to baumgartners suit recorded his freefall of just over four minutes which failed to break the existing freefall record for duration and then the parachute opening the success of the mission and of the suit raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle columbia in by actually bailing out of their craft baumgartners top medical man in the stunt was dr jonathan clark whose wife laurel clark died in the columbia accident clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts chances of survival in a highaltitude disaster baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring the former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a foot deep cave he had already done two practice freefalls in preparation for this attempt one from feet in march and a second from feet in july but no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of roswell a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to ufo sightings he was chasing five different records the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free fall the highest freefall altitude jump the highest manned balloon flight the longest freefall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history the stunt which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by red bull drinks beat two of kittingers records the retired us air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting kittinger jumped from a balloon miles above the planet in suitably the only voice in baumgartners radio earpiece guiding his ascent was that of kittinger now asked after the jump what he wanted to do next baumgartner said i want to inspire a generation id like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as joe kittinger there is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record he said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule on top of the world to laughter he added the most beautiful moment was when i was standing on the landing area and mike todd the life support engineer who dressed baumgartner in his suit showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid baumgartner said that he had come to feel like todds son adding he was so happy that i was alive earlier todd had told the press conference the world needs a hero right now and they got one in felix baumgartner to further laughter at the press conference kittinger said i would like to give a special onefingered salute to all the folk who said that he baumgartner was going to come apart when he went supersonic this will be the last jump baumgartner said he has promised to settle down and enjoy his postjump years with his girlfriend nicole oetl flying helicopters on rescue missions in the us and austria n,adv,Skydiver

valdevaqueros is one of the last remaining unspoilt beaches in southern spain where the sky above the golden sands is filled with kites hauling surfers over the waves currently the beach has little more than an access road lined with camper vans from germany france italy and britain filled with windsurfers and kitesurfers lured by the areas strong winds for decades it has been a world apart from the concretelined beaches of torremolinos and marbella along the coast yet on may the local council in tarifa approved plans to build a tourist complex right next to the beach with hotel rooms and flats environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species but for most councillors here the issue is simple jobs in this town of inhabitants are out of work as spain faces its worst economic crisis in at least half a century one that has cast doubt on the future of the euro traditional sources of income such as fishing are dying out now that fleets are being dismantled and fish stocks are depleted so tourism is the only way out as long as it is sustainable said sebastin galindo a councillor from the socialist party which is in opposition in tarifa but voted with the governing peoples party to give the project the green light tarifas mayor juan andrs gil declined to comment on the project but galindo said it complies with environmental standards the complex would be metres from the coast comfortably beyond the minimum of metres stipulated by a law designed to prevent more ugly developments like those that blighted much of spains coastline when mass tourism first descended on its shores in the s and s opponents of the complex say the last thing anyone needs is more housing in a country that already has a million empty homes although the central government last week proposed a selloff by granting nonspaniards residency permits in return for buying property worth at least the socialist opposition in madrid attacked the proposal and galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who flocked to spain during the boom years many of them from morocco whose coastline is just km away and can be seen from tarifa it favours moneyed classes rather than those who came here to help spain get ahead he said surfers fear that new buildings in valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local levant wind but fail to lure traditional package holidaymakers its not really a family spot just wait until they see what a levant is like said henning mayer who has regularly made the journey from augsburg in germany for years ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here it didnt happen so i think it will be impossible to build new hotels at the southernmost tip of spain tarifa is the strategic crossroads between africa and europe where the mediterranean sea meets the atlantic campaigners say it also has a vital role in the animal world as a crossroads for migrating species the campaign to save the beach was launched hours after the tarifa council voted for the project the campaign has a facebook page and is supported by groups including greenpeace the world wide fund for nature and the spanish branch of conservation network birdlife its the environmental equivalent of putting a shopping centre right in the middle of the alhambra said noelia jurado who uses her multimedia expertise to campaign against the complex she also noted that the resort would be near the ancient roman town of baelo claudia they could be building on top of more roman ruins here nobody knows also joining the opposition to the planned resort is the andalusian college of geographers which in a preliminary study charted on its website concluded that free areas including car parks if not actual buildings will overlap part of the alcornocales national park the geographers also estimate that the site intrudes on two wildlife conservation areas one of the areas in valdevaqueros is home to two species of bat whose survival is threatened money is once again being put before urban laws and european environmental directives said ral romeva a member of the european parliament who is vicepresident of the greens group in romevas view the project is also at fault because the proposed site has too little water in a town that already suffers from shortages in the summer weather that scorches the southern spanish region of andalusa lack of water recently led the andalusa supreme court to uphold an appeal against plans to build a complex elsewhere in the region which would have included golf courses hotels and luxury homes many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built km away rather than on wasteland near tarifas picturesque old centre with its typically andalusian whitewashed walls and winding streets dominated by a thcentury moorish castle my opinion and that of catering workers is that we agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town which is what is needed but we are against it being for the benefit of a few said cristbal lobato who has worked at the same beachside bar in tarifa for years if they put it in the centre of tarifa where there is space then clients could visit shops tapas bars and restaurants overlooking the green fields earmarked for building biologist aitor galn who conducts environmental impact studies for a living pointed at one of only two seaside breeding grounds for vultures in europe anywhere else in europe this place would have the utmost protection but here they want to get rid of it

dame sally davies the chief medical officer for england has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism while this might sound like an exaggeration the threat was actually if anything understated each year the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks while it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species the world health organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multidrug resistance accounts for more than deaths each year antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk this is now a war in the past hundred years our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition at the beginning of the twentieth century life expectancy in the uk stood at around years of age for a man and for a woman a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five largely because of infectious disease in contrast a child born in britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their th birthday for this we have public health systems vaccination and antibiotics to thank it is by these means the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms that the real war against disease is principally won elsewhere we have pushed the limits of survival notably in intensive care this the specialism in which i chose to train is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent here powerful antibiotics essential in the treatment of lifethreatening illness are used routinely these drugs decimate ordinary bacteria but what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs as a newly qualified doctor in the late s i learnt about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus the infamous mrsa a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins in the fight against it there were a handful of exoticsounding drugs vancomycin and teicoplanin among them these were supposed to be our last lines of defence but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common as did species with new patterns of resistance drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace new lastline drugs emerged to replace the old we got used to this state of affairs a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria but the balance has been shifting steadily in our hospitals and our gp surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease using them too often and too indiscriminately and some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare with antibiotics introduced into the food chain through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with antibacterial drugs we assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever we became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game but this is no longer the case new more resistant species have been identified the vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat mrsa infection was defeated vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus vrsa emerged in our hospitals and other bacterial species were learning the same trick enterobacteria organisms usually found in the gut had also acquired vancomycin resistance today infections with formidable highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs are emerging from their production lines it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains for every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent bacteria rapidly evolve a defence all of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance consequently the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the s the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged initially these were little more than curiosities when they did infect patients the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention but today they have become a fact of medical life less than a century after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight since the first mrsa deaths in otherwise healthy children in the us in the number of deaths from mrsa infection in the us each year has risen to tens of thousands outstripping the number of deaths caused by aids bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look this is a war like no other there needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture and somehow the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs within my working lifetime the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion if we are to avoid a return to the preantibiotic time with all its excess mortality we must be bold to squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable,adv,Superbugs
the chief medical officer for england compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism but each year the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks the world health organization says that each year more than people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance this is now a war a hundred years ago life expectancy in the uk was about years for a man and years for a woman lots of young children died about of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease but a child born in britain today has more than a chance of reaching their th birthday we can thank public health systems vaccination and antibiotics for this in intensive care antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common here powerful antibiotics are used very often these drugs kill ordinary bacteria but they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs when i became a doctor in the s i learnt about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins there were just a few drugs that could kill it for example vancomycin and teicoplanin but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common in our hospitals and our doctors surgeries we use antiobiotics too often also we have put antibiotics into the food chain when we grow food and when we put antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals we thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever we thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics but this is no longer true we have found new more resistant bacteria the vancomycin that we used to treat mrsa infection no longer worked we found vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus vrsa in our hospitals and other bacteria were becoming resistant too today infections with organisms that are very resistant are common but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made it is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance this war against bacteria is different from all other wars there needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming and we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics which will not make them lots of money today antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fightn,ele,Superbugs

swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive but are the countrys prisons a soft option the head of swedens prison and probation service nils oberg announced in november that four swedish prisons are to be closed due to an out of the ordinary decline in prisoner numbers although there has been no fall in crime rates between and there was a drop in swedens prisoner population now a little over a similar decrease is expected in and oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run we certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact he said the modern prison service in sweden is very different from when i joined as a young prison officer in says kenneth gustafsson governor of kumla prison swedens most secure jail situated miles west of stockholm however he doesnt think the system has gone soft when i joined the focus was very much on humanity in prisons prisoners were treated well maybe too well some might say but after a number of highprofile escapes in we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security despite the hardening of attitudes toward prison security following the escape scandals the swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing even of the most serious offenders jail terms rarely exceed ten years those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term usually in the region of to years sweden was the first country in europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize shortterm prison sentences wherever possible by using communitybased measures which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending the overall reoffending rate in sweden stands at between and over three years to compare that with another european country the number is around half that of the uk one likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in sweden below per head of population is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at in the uk for example children aged ten to and young people under the age of record the highest reoffending rates almost three quarters and two thirds respectively a good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails in sweden no young person under the age of can be sentenced to life this is not the case in many other countries and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison one strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of postprison support available in sweden a confident probation service a government agency is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programmes for offenders with drug alcohol or violence issues the service is assisted by around lay supervisors members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the swedish justice department in and the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behaviour for many years we have been running programmes to help those addicted to drugs now we are also developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence these are the important things for our society when these people are released i spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called xcons sweden peter soderlund served almost three years of a fouryear sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in he was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called kris criminals return into society the big difference between kris and us is that we are happy to allow people who are still taking addiction medications to join us he says both organizations work with the same goal helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released and what is life like for the prisoner in sweden when i was inside i was lucky in osteraker prison where i served my sentence the governor was enlightened we were treated well but i knew that not all swedish prisons were like that i met so many people in there who needed help after i received help from kris i knew i wanted to help others with xcons we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support in sweden we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation without being naive of course says gustafsson there are some people who will not or cannot change but in my experience the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that it is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence also it is not just prison that can rehabilitate it is often a combined process involving probation and greater society we can give education and training but when they leave prison these people need housing and jobs n,adv,Swedish prisons

pounding rebel positions the sound of war getting closer to syrias capital but just over two years into the syrian crisis the longest and bloodiest of the arab uprisings ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for damascenes over the weekend men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palmshaded park children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby ottomanera mosque no one seemed to notice actually you do get used to it after a while said george an it technician from a village on the coast but you never know exactly what they are hitting that usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on youtube the sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual as you can see everything

at addis ababa airport visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains minute ochrered seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake billboards boast teff the ultimate glutenfree crop ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries well known for its precarious food security situation but it is also the native home of teff a highly nutritious ancient grain increasingly finding its way into healthfood shops and supermarkets in europe and america teffs tiny seeds the size of poppy seeds are high in calcium iron and protein and boast an impressive set of amino acids naturally gluten free the grain can substitute for wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases like quinoa the andean grain teffs superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west in ethiopia teff is a national obsession grown by an estimated million farmers fields of the crop cover more than of all land under cultivation ground into flour and used to make injera the spongy fermented flatbread that is basic to ethiopian cuisine the grain is central to many religious and cultural ceremonies across the country and in neighbouring eritrea diners gather around large pieces of injera which doubles as cutlery scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship a tradition known as gursha outside diaspora communities in the west teff has flown under the radar for decades but a growing appetite for traditional crops and booming healthfood and glutenfree markets are breathing new life into the grain increasingly touted as ethiopias second gift to the world after coffee sophie kebede a londonbased entrepreneur who owns a uk company specializing in the grain says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value i didnt know it was so sought after i am of ethiopian origin ive been eating injera all my life growing demand for socalled ancient grains has not always been a straightforward win for poor communities in bolivia and peru reports of rising incomes owing to the nowglobal quinoa trade have come alongside those of malnutrition and conflicts over land as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand ethiopias growing middle class is also pushing up demand for teff and rising domestic prices have put the grain out of reach of the poorest today most small farmers sell the bulk of what they grow to consumers in the city this may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences says the government as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country estimates suggest that while those in urban areas eat up to kg of teff a year in rural areas the figure is kg the type consumed differs too the wealthy almost exclusively eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties less welloff consumers tend to eat lessvaluable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize the ethiopian government wants to double teff production by its strategy published in argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children and adolescents though ethiopia has a fastgrowing economy it remains on the uns list of leastdeveloped countries an estimated of underfives are malnourished or suffer stunted growth the governments agricultural transformation agency aims to boost yields by developing improved varieties of the grain along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce postharvest losses government restrictions instituted in forbid the export of raw teff grain only allowing shipments of injera and other processed products but this could change the goal is to produce enough teff for domestic consumption and a strong export market according to the governments strategy mama fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the ethiopian capital for years it also ships the flatbread to finland germany sweden and the us primarily for consumption by diaspora communities but the company has its eye on the glutenfree market it aims to double exports to america in and will soon start producing teffbased pizzas bread and cookies typically these products are going to go through many hands before they reach the shelves of sainsburys or wherever there are profit margins at every step and small farmers are not necessarily well placed to bargain with the bigger traders says david hallam trade and markets director at the uns food and agriculture organization he sees quinoas popularity as a cautionary tale of how export opportunities can be a mixed blessing for poor countries regassa feyissa an ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the national institute for biodiversity warns that without careful planning increased teff production for export may displace other important crops for farmers and efforts to boost production could benefit business interests at the expense of small farmers with little ethiopian teff on the international market farmers in the us have started planting the crop farmers in europe israel and australia have also experimented with it kebede says she gets her grain from farms in southern europe though she would prefer to source it from ethiopia teff is second nature to an ethiopian so who better to supply it we have this soughtafter grain being grown in the country so why cant an ethiopian farmer benefit from this n,adv,Teff

margaret thatcher the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in and a global champion of the late thcentury free market economic revival has died the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st pauls cathedral the british prime minister david cameron who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news said it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatchers death weve lost a great leader a great prime minister and a great briton he added as our first woman prime minister margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didnt just lead our country she saved our country and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister in a statement president barack obama said here in america many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history we can shape them with moral conviction unyielding courage and iron will the first woman elected to lead a major western state lady thatcher as she became after the longest premiership since served unbroken years at no downing street thatcher who was had been in declining health for some years suffering from dementia after a series of ministrokes in thatcher withdrew from public life no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office and beyond her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect its leader ed miliband said she will be remembered as a unique figure she reshaped the politics of a whole generation she was britains first woman prime minister she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength the deputy prime minister nick clegg said margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics whatever side of the political debate you stand on no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served describing her as a political phenomenon the former tory prime minister sir john major said her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her courage and determination in politics and humanity and generosity of spirit in private the iron lady proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could do business as a result many ordinary voters in exsoviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion though not at home or among key eu partners thatcher was an unremarkable midranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in within a decade she had become known around the world both admired and detested for her promarket domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy including her longrunning battle with the ira which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel brighton in at home the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of stateowned industry the new word privatization came into widespread use in many countries and defeat of militant trade unionists notably the national union of miners whose yearlong strike was bitter and traumatic boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britains north sea oil fields thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies including moderate members of her own party but she also deployed her notorious handbaggings or verbal attacks in the european union to obtain a british rebate my money as she called it she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the belgian empire her description of the european commission especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors her allies in the tabloid press egged her on and as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it to tame the unions and cure inflation she briefly seemed invincible but untrammelled power with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check led to mistakes and growing unpopularity when sir geoffrey howe nominally her deputy finally fell out with thatcher chiefly over europe his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot in retirement she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation which sought to promote her values around the world n,adv,Thatcher

in canadas arctic summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than hours a day for some its a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter but for the small but growing muslim community of iqaluit nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of ramadan during which muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset i havent fainted once said yearold abdul karim one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his ramadan fast to the arctic sun since moving from ottawa in this year that means eating at about am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about pm when the sun sets the only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health karim said pointing to his sizable frame he laughed as he added but looking at my condition i dont think fasting will hurt me as the end of ramadan draws near for muslims around the world much of the holy months focus on community work prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world but in iqaluit and the other muslim communities in the arctic the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached most in iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by muslims in ottawa some miles south of the city following the advice of muslim scholars who have said muslims in the far north should observe ramadan using the timetable of mecca or the nearest muslim city it still means fasting for some hours a day said atif jilani who moved to iqaluit from toronto in its long days but more manageable many in the strong community break their fast together gathering in the citys brand new mosque completed in february amid temperatures that dropped as low as c with wind chill for nightly suppers as they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries the sun shines brightly through the windows its a scene that plays out across canadas northernmost mosques during ramadan as muslim communities wrestle with the countrys unique geography the or so muslims in yellowknife in the northwest territories have several options when it comes to fasting during ramadan said nazim awan president of the yellowknife islamic centre with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill there might be some superhumans who want to fast for hours but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of mecca and medina in recent years much of the community has opted to follow the ramadan timetable of edmonton in alberta some such as awan a father of two young children including a yearold who recently started fasting follow the timings of mecca he hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about hours of fasting as compared with about hours in edmonton if i fast yellowknife or edmonton times my son might say papa you are really insane what are you doing he said faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun the or so muslims in inuvik a small town that sits miles north of the arctic circle have also been following edmontons timetable we currently have hours a day of sun said ahmad alkhalaf theres no sunrise or sunset the adherence to edmontons schedule was already in place in when he moved from toronto to the small northern community of people my first ramadan here was in december theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night so we used edmonton time at times it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside alkhalaf said youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk and we eat when the sun is out its not usual to have iftar the meal breaking the fast when the sun is up he said in inuvik where much of the population is inuit the muslim community has sought to strike a balance between ramadan and the local culture and traditions the iftar meal includes dates and rich curries as well as local game such as reindeer prepared in accordance with islamic law we make a soup or curry but instead of using beef we use reindeer in iqaluit as the muslim community prepares to mark the end of ramadan some reflect that s timing stretching across some of the longest days of the year has made it one of the more challenging of recent years its particularly true for those like karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset but his efforts will be rewarded years from now said karim thanks to the lunar calendar ramadan will eventually fall during winter which in iqaluit sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh oh yes definitely n,adv,WNL Arctic Ramadan
google has made maps of the worlds highest mountains the ocean floor the amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of north korea they want to make maps of the whole world but they have mostly stayed away from the arctic now however google is starting a very important update to hundreds of years of polar map making and it hopes that the map will help give a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users a small google team has flown to iqaluit the largest town in the canadian territory of nunavut they have taken their warmest winter clothes many laptop computers and an kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks the team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on baffin island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted an inuit mapping expert helped the google team and curious locals followed them around the town of people will go on display via googles popular street view application in july when google made maps of other parts of the world it used a special camera on a car roof in iqaluit that was not possible so googles map makers walked the towns snowy roads and trails some roads are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months the team also walked along part of a km road known as the road to nowhere despite warnings about meeting polar bears the online map that google had already created using satellite images was mostly correct but one road was missing that had been built in the last year one difficulty was how to place on the map many businesses and homes that have mail sent to the local post office and not delivered to their address putting the po box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies banks and schools in the same place around the canada post building in the centre of town about inuit elders business people and highschool pupils helped google to correct this problem they were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map the project is more than a novelty arif sayani the towns director of planning said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area it may also help planning decisions in iqaluit happen more quickly the project leader for google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns but moving people and equipment around the vast arctic territory is very expensive so in the future google might send equipment to the area and ask volunteers to complete the map,ele,WNL Arctic Ramadan

there are certainly mooc junkies who take them for no other reason than theyre free and they like hanging out grins dr ben brabon of edgehill university whose massive open online course in vampire fiction is one of only two accredited moocs currently on offer in the uk brabon isnt denigrating people who enrol on mooc courses hes simply pointing out the motivation that prompts certain individuals to sign up when a course is open entry moocs have no enrolment criteria and no fees to pay then participants are going to behave very differently from students in a traditional higher education setting moocs are the newest big thing in the quest to enable higher education for all a great deal of venture capital money is being invested in the emerging online platforms which enable the delivery of increasingly sophisticated and interactive course content to participants who can number in the hundreds to the tens of thousands for these investors the holy grail is to find a business model for moocs that will make them profitable so far courses have depended on universities being prepared to bankroll their star lecturers curriculum design and online teaching time mining the data captured about how why and when millions of participants opt to sign up interact with their material submit their assignments message each other and drop out of the course may be one way of getting a return on the investment part of the dilemma around which future direction moocs will take however is that nobody can yet define whom exactly they are meant to benefit universities keen to entice fee paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online students in developing countries hungry for access to firstworld universities employees wishing to develop their professional knowledge people lacking qualifications who want to use moocs as a bridge to higher education or hobby learners who are keen to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest though they may be popular to start off with moocs have dire completion rates observes brabon for his vampire fiction course that meant enrolments and completions and almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level he says so the moocs trend may not be opening up he to sectors of the population it hasnt reached to date learning online is a different thing needs quite advanced learning skills confirms david kernohan progamme manager for elearning innovation at jisc a charity that champions the use of digital technologies in uk education and research with moocs theres very little support available the student is dropped in and tends not to get any individual attention this is instead approximated by peer support such as online discussion forums while this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without highlevel qualifications it does he says suggest that moocs could be a really good tool for continuing education at a time when the number of parttime students has fallen sharply as the price of a degree rises could this type of open and freetoaccess course provide a new path to universitylevel education could an entire degree be taught via moocs i dont think thats how moocs work says brabon instead he suggests a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a mooc also perhaps using moocs to create a global degree with students taking courses from across the world might be possible but thats a little way into the future for now no prospective employer will care much if you come waving your mooc completion certificate without any quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards accreditation is therefore now the central challenge that moocs must grapple with to gain credibility with academics and employers says brabon who is on a quality assurance agency working group aiming to develop an agreed approach to standards and marking there is idealism around the concept of moocs bringing the best of firstworld teaching to students in less developed countries but theres cynicism too with the suggestion that universities could use moocs to advertise their oncampus wares to greater numbers of lucrative though certainly not always wealthy students from outside the eu mike sharples chair of educational technology doesnt buy into that cynicism moocs are viewed primarily as a way to showcase and share universities best teaching talent as well as encouraging interaction and soliciting feedback from students around the world he says he believes that recruiting international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of running moocs though they could certainly be a very canny marketing move as he observes that if people sign up to a mooc well you only need of those to enrol afterwards to run a masters meanwhile any politically correct qualms about whether uk academic institutions are patronizing developing countries by exporting small snippets of elitist education may soon be entirely irrelevant warns matthew poyiadgi managing director at pearson vue i believe we may get to a situation in the future where universities maybe wont have a choice and where british universities are saying if we dont have a presence in china then well get left behind he says in south america china countries in africa there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the worlds best courses are being offered online adds sharples if people are genuinely fascinated by learning then why not the real challenge is to allow those countries not just to consume and study moocs but also to create them n,adv,WNL Are MOOCs the future

the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives armed with anonymous metadata on peoples calls and texts but not the content of the communications two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals names where they lived and the names of their partners but that was not all the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals one man was found to own a rifle while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata the number called when and for how long particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google yelp and facebook the value of the data which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of peoples communications has long been recognized by the security services as stewart baker the former general counsel at the us national security agency nsa put it in the aftermath of edward snowdens revelations metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebodys life patrick mutchler a computer security researcher at stanford said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them now we have hard evidence we can point to that didnt exist in the past he said for the study the researchers signed up people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app the app also received information from their facebook accounts which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results in all the researchers gathered metadata on more than calls and over m texts analysts who logged into the nsas metadatagathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual a call from the target individuals phone to another number was one hop from that phone to another was two hops and so on the records available to analysts stretched back for five years the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and months at most writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences mutchler describes how on a shoestring budget he and fellow graduate student jonathan mayer uncovered a wealth of personal information some of it sensitive about people who took part in the study through automatic and manual searches they identified of peoples names the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called when these were plotted on a map they revealed clusters of local businesses which the scientists speculated surrounded the persons home address in this way they named the city people lived in of the time and were nearly accurate in placing people within miles of their home mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents home for example to go to college the scientists next delved into more personal territory using a simple computer program to analyse peoples call patterns they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner identifying the significant other was easy they report for the final part of the study the researchers delved even deeper to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations including hospitals pharmacies religious groups legal services firearms retailers and repair firms from these they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from peoples lives the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre spoke briefly with a medical laboratory answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heartrate monitoring devices another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semi automatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources said mutchler who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes largescale metadata surveillance programmes like the nsas will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens the scientists write adding to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences ross anderson professor of security engineering at cambridge university said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on with the right analytics running over nation scale communications data you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone we always suspected that of course but heres the data

two scientists at stanford university in the usa used metadata on peoples telephone calls and texts to find out peoples names where they lived and the names of their partners the metadata told them what number people called when and for how long but it didnt tell them what people said but that was not all with the same metadata they could find out private information about some people they discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem other data told them that someone was having a baby and someone had a serious illness the results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata it is particularly powerful when you use it together with information from google yelp and facebook then the scientists used a simple computer program to analyse peoples calls and this helped them to see who was in a relationship once they knew the owner of a particular phone number had a partner it was easy to find out who the partner was they said for the final part of the study the researchers looked even deeper to see what private information they could get from telephone metadata they collected details on calls made to and from places such as hospitals pharmacies religious groups legal services and gun shops from these they produced interesting pictures of peoples lives mutchler said the study showed how easy it is to find out private information about people he says that the results should make governments think twice before they record this information metadata programmes like the nsas will show very private information about ordinary people the scientists said stewart baker who worked at the us national security agency nsa said metadata tells you everything about somebodys life patrick mutchler a researcher at stanford said that people who collect the information understand the power of metadata but that the public was in the dark for the study people agreed for researchers to collect metadata from their phones using an app the app also received information from their facebook pages which the scientists used to check their results the scientists collected metadata on more than calls and over million texts with very little money mutchler and jonathan mayer found out a lot of personal information about the people in the study some of the information was private they found out of peoples names the same method gave them the names of businesses the people called when they marked these on a map they showed groups of local businesses which the scientists guessed were near the persons home address in this way they named the city people lived in of the time and were nearly correct in guessing within miles where people livedn,ele,WNL Basic phone logs

a group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance this is causing problems says the charity sense about science who have written a guide to allergies its a big mess said tracey brown director of sense about science there is unnecessary action for people who dont really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy but some of these people dont have an allergy that have a food intolerance which is not dangerous experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies when maybe that is not true that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy it matters very much said moira austin of an allergy charity if a restaurant thinks somebody just doesnt want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable the restaurant may be less careful there have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food the guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work they include a test people can use at home which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood these antibodies are part of the bodys response to infections but the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy the guide says the test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true another test also does not work it uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy testing hair is also pointless the guide says hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies i often see children who are on very limited diets their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken allergy tests that do not work said paul seddon an allergy doctor for children this needs to stop which can only happen if we prove these tests do not work allergies can cause tiredness headaches and eczema in children but you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests it may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer but it will be a wrong answer allergies are increasing in developed countries there are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to years ago the sense about science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies for example the myths that fast food or e numbers in food colourings cause allergiesn,ele,WNL Bogus Allergy

they are the darkness seekers and they are growing in number on black fell looking down on northumberlands beautiful kielder water reservoir a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future this is kielder observatory the centre of britains nascent astrotourism industry and those waiting outside were the lucky ones many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited inside next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights the observatorys founder and lead astronomer gary fildes a former bricklayer with tarzan hair delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful instead they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station remember fildes tells his team its about interaction its about entertainment its about inspiring people he puts on some music pink floyd the jam the pogues by the sky is going to be sexy fildes says its going to be epic fildes is at the forefront of the uks burgeoning astrotourism industry the pivotal moment for northumberland came in when the entire national park housing hadrians wall along with kielder water and forest park some sq km was awarded dark sky park status the only one in england dark sky parks are rare the star count revealed that only of the uk population can see more than stars on a good night the tucson arizonabased international darksky association ida confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark in northumberland dark sky park as the area was rebadged it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth duncan wise visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority helped to spearhead the campaign for darksky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britains most tranquil places we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon wise said but what about whats above it wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils parks bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area their efforts have been vindicated many of the million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now says the man at the carhire firm in newcastle they come in autumn and winter when its darkest good for the bbs as they get business all year round now local hoteliers now issue guests with nightvision torches and put out deckchairs at night those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are dark sky friendly wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for a m national landscape discovery centre which he describes as the norths answer to the eden project will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years fildes has grand designs he is planning britains first astrovillage one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a seat auditorium a seat planetarium a onemetre aperture telescope and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes the multimillionpound project would feature a hotel and draw in people a year four times the number currently able to use the observatory fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by however northumberland faces competition galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status since exmoor was designated europes first international dark sky reserve one notch below dark sky park in a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination so what is driving the desire to look upwards the media have helped tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers brian cox has made astronomy accessible says wise its no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes technology has also played a part apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocketsize planetariums ultimately though fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch what could be better than the universe n,adv,WNL Bright Future

the roof is plastic held up by a crooked tree trunk and the desks just a jumble of castoff chairs but the students inside the chemin des dunes school are studying with the same intensity you would find in a seminar at oxford university at stake is the hope of a new life in france the french language is very difficult but we try hard if we come every day maybe we can touch our dreams says kamal a refugee from sudans wartorn darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day its a good thing to keep your brain active the yearold electrical engineer is one of dozens perhaps hundreds of refugees living in the jungle camp outside calais who have applied for asylum in france and are eager to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home like many of his fellow students he is frustrated that media coverage of the sprawling tentvillage has focused only on those who use it as a staging post for risky nightly bids to sneak on board crosschannel lorries or trains i need to tell people in the uk they think that everyone wants to go there but there are a lot of people here who want to stay in france kamal said france is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees according to united nations data the country has taken in more than twice as many as the uk even though the countries have similar populations there are a further asylum seekers waiting for their claim to a french safe haven to be processed the second highest number in europe while in the uk there are while the applicants wait for an answer though france does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work and the slow process can take many months the jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads so many decide to endure the basic conditions for a few extra months rather than potentially jeopardize their asylum bid by working illegally the idea for the school was first touted by some of that group at the start of the summer when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in france totally unable to communicate it was a reality within weeks opening on july we did it to reunite the brothers and at the same time they can learn french said zimarco jones the schools nigerian founder who arrived in calais in and is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed now we need to build another one he says with a grin at its busiest the tiny classroom holds pupils crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the french alphabet there are also classes in english art and tai chi but the biggest draw is the french lessons provided by volunteers from calais and beyond french is not as easy as english but two weeks ago i decided there was no way to get to the uk says george another darfur refugee and dedicated student he wanted to cross the channel because he speaks fluent english but with language classes he says he is happy to settle in france anywhere there is peace i can stay no problem he says already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive he admits he doesnt know much about france but says that the classes are slowly helping him understand the country as well as the language many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays jenny flahaut who works at a childrens home was inspired to volunteer after seeing an advertisement on facebook i saw these people in calais every day and i wanted to do something for them she said she is particularly frustrated by the depiction of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the camp most recently david cameron the british prime minister who in a much criticized speech talked about swarms of people trying to reach the uk they dont know them and have a bad vision but they are not like that flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson most of them are very good people they are welcoming and friendly they want to improve their life and make it better and learning is part of that the teachers and zimarco are focused now on setting up a separate classroom to serve around women and two dozen children the women are outnumbered around ten to one by men in the calais encampment and most feel uncomfortable attending classes with male students they dont know the volunteers say when that is finished the former hotel worker whose work getting the school off the ground is remembered in its unofficial name everyone in the camp just calls it zimarcos school has more dreams for making the camp a place to live not just survive he wants to set up a football team for migrants he explains over an instant cappuccino in the immaculate tent he calls home and even dreams of changing the camp name he hates the jungle because he says it implies the residents arent people we have a discotheque a house a mosque a school shops he says we are not animals n,adv,WNL Calais Migrants

when larry pizzi a veteran bicycle industry executive first heard about electric bikes nearly years ago he asked why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it its a question that still puzzles traditionalists bicycle shops have been slow to stock ebikes even though they have been around since the late s sales in the us have been modest pizzi who is now ceo of currie technologies the number one seller of ebikes in the us believes thats about to change others in the industry agree familiar brands including trek raleigh and specialized all offer electric models and theyre betting the market is about to take off were on the cusp of mainstream adoption pizzi said there are more players entering the category it seems with every passing month the us is an outlier when it comes to electric bikes nearly m ebikes were sold in the vast majority in china where they are primarily used for transportation they are popular in much of europe too theyre common in the netherlands and switzerland german postal workers use them to get around and bmw offers one for about electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds which rely on motorized power they are bicycles that can be pedalled with or without assistance from an electric motor riding an ebike feels like riding a conventional bike with a brisk tailwind the motor helps you go faster or climb hills but its typically not the primary source of propulsion unlike mopeds ebicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they cant travel faster than mph theres debate about how many electric bikes are sold in the us and there is no official count estimates of annual sales range from about to thats comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the us in yet while many people are aware of the nissan leaf chevy volt and tesla few have heard of ebike companies currie pedego or electrobike to succeed the electric bike business in the us must clear legal cultural and financial hurdles ebikes are banned in some states including new york although the law isnt strictly enforced traditionalists who own and staff bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles citing among other things the added weight some ebikes are close to kg ebikes are also pricey while lowend models sell for as little as court rye the founder and editor of electricbikereviewcom a popular website says riders should expect to pay at least for a quality ebike with a good battery topoftheline models cost more than twice that the companies that make and sell ebikes say they can overcome those obstacles ebike technology particularly the batteries is improving batteries are getting smaller theyre getting lighter theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer says don dicostanza the founder and ceo of pedego an electric bikemaker and retailer companies like bosch the german electronics giant and shimano the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears are entering the business which should help erode resistance from bike shops this has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers says curries larry pizzi pedego and startup electrobike arent waiting for the shops to come around they are building their own stores in the meantime lobbying efforts are underway to permit the use of ebikes everywhere perhaps most importantly as more cities build cycling infrastructure including dedicated bike lanes bicycle commuting has become more popular as the us census bureau reported in the number of bike commuters grew from about in to in thats a larger percentage increase than that of any other commuting mode the report notes electric bikes make commuting more practical and fun by easing worry about hills headwinds fatigue and sweat most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid says pedegos don dicostanza the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills pedego has opened nearly stores in the us and it has sold bikes to tour companies in san francisco and washington dc electrobike which operates stores in mexico opened its first american store in venice beach california in the autumn of and hopes to grow to us stores in a year ceo craig anderson says we want to help reduce traffic help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle he tells customers ride this once and try not to smile startups like pedego and electrobike will have to compete with big companies like trek and currie which in was acquired by the accell group a public company based in the netherlands that is europes market leader in ebikes accell owns the raleigh brand as well as haibike an awardwinning german electric bike accell has great expectations about ebikes in north america curries larry pizzi says while baby boomers are still a very important segment were finding that a lot of younger people are using ebikes for transportation instead of cars accells yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with

he had the tastes of a typical millionaire he owned a gold and silver rolex and a fleet of expensive cars he liked to dabble in modern art but although this chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the madrid suburbs he had almost no money in the bank a detail that piqued the interest of spanish authorities gao ping who had lived most of his adult life in spain had a monopoly on supplies to chinese bazaars across the mediterranean country but authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes furniture and other goods he was importing from china when police swooped on his warehouses in they found piles of cash wads of and notes were wrapped in elastic bands around m was wheeled away in trolleys the largest ever cash seizure by spanish police the gang with gao the alleged ringleader stands accused of laundering up to m a year as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks the government prosecutor said gaos illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of spain gao is on bail the case has not yet come to trial law enforcement officials have long had concerns about notes small and easy to transport relative to their value they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers money launderers and drug barons the sum of m in notes fits easily into a small laptop bag where the same amount in notes would require a small suitcase cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them a less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis the uk stopped distribution of the note in on the grounds that demand for it was almost entirely for criminal purposes in italys central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists other countries have limited their own high denomination notes due to links to organized crime canada scrapped its note in on the advice of law enforcement officers in an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified peter sands the former head of standard chartered bank has called for the abolition of highdenomination notes including the the the swiss franc note and the in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government sands argued it was time to get rid of highvalue notes that make life easier for bad guys pursuing tax evasion financial crime terrorist finance and corruption although criminals would switch to smaller denomination bills or gold or diamonds these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable making it more likely they will get caught he said at a conference on terrorist financing in london the head of europol rob wainwright called on the european central bank ecb to look at whether it should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities according to europol the purple note accounts for of the value of all the euro notes in circulation although most people have never seen one the note was introduced in when the euro was born it replaced the deutschmark the belgian franc and the italian lira several european countries favoured high value banknotes it is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time says pia httl an affiliate fellow at the bruegel thinktank the preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere cash remains king in germany and austria where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins the former president of germanys constitutional court hansjrgen papier told germanys frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom while tabloid newspaper bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money including the note hands off my cash law enforcement authorities are less convinced amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash in one case that has caught the attention of police two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit of torn and muddy notes in the same week m in notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase but a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that in many jurisdictions it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality says jennifer macleod a specialist in europols financial intelligence group the search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange the agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the striking anomalies in the use of notes luxembourg for example issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in alone despite being one of the most cashaverse countries in europe europol asked luxembourgs central bank to explain the reply we had from luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand macleod says i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area this could be changing mario draghi the head of the ecb has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be a comfort for criminals other members of the ecbs top team such as yves mersch contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the note but amid heightened fears about terrorism this argument may no longer cut any ice eu finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore appropriate

until the last david bowie who has died of cancer was still capable of springing surprises his latest album blackstar appeared on his th birthday on january and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging disturbing music hadnt deserted him throughout the s bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion having been a lates mime and cabaret entertainer he evolved into a singersongwriter a pioneer of glamrock then veered into what he called plastic soul before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music his capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history bowie was born david robert jones in south london in the family moved to kent where david showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder later he studied art music and design in davids mother bought him a plastic saxophone introducing him to an instrument which would become a recurring ingredient in his music at david formed his first band the konrads it was clear that davids talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo david adopted the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees bowies first album released in june was titled simply david bowie in july bowie released space oddity the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough timed to coincide with the apollo moon landing it was a top five uk hit in march bowie married art student angela barnett artistically bowie was powering ahead the man who sold the world was released in the us in late and in the uk the following year and with its daring songwriting and broody hardrock sound it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts the albums themes included immortality insanity murder and mysticism evidence that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pops usual boundaries he followed it with s hunky dory a mix of wordy elaborate songwriting it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year this time bowie emerged as a fully fledged sciencefiction character an intergalactic glamrock star visiting a doomed planet earth and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom the hit single starman brought instant success for the album while bowies ravishing stage costumes and provocative performances triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since beatlemania everything bowie touched turned to gold he had his first uk number album with aladdin sane which generated the hit singles the jean genie and drivein saturday but bowie was already planning fresh career moves his increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable young americans which gave him a us charttopper with fame featuring john lennon as a guest vocalist station to station introduced a new persona the thin white duke which bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as a melancholy space traveller in nicolas roegs film the man who fell to earth bowies relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in this was a year of further creative triumph bringing a fine album scary monsters and super creeps and its spin off charttopping single ashes to ashes followed by bowies wellreceived stint as john merrick in the elephant man on the broadway stage he achieved a number single with his partnership with queen under pressure while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media he appeared in the german movie christiane f and wrote music for the soundtrack he had another chart hit with cat people putting out fire from paul schraders movie cat people bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in the hunger and the second world war drama merry christmas mr lawrence both released in musically this was the year in which he put his energy into an allout commercial onslaught with the album lets dance and followup concerts lets dance moulded bowie into a crowdfriendly global rock star with the album and its singles lets dance china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits this was the heyday of mtv and bowies knack for eyecatching videos fuelled this commercial splurge while the sixmonth serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career his profile gained another boost from his appearance at the live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium where he was one of the standout performers in addition he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street which sped to number a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york this new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration for the album black tie white noise he sprinkled elements of soul electronica and hip hop into the mix it topped the uk album chart and yielded a top single jump they say new media and technology influenced his recordings too his album hours was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron in which bowie and iman appeared as characters the birth of bowie and imans daughter alexandria followed in august as an adopted new yorker bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october where he joined paul mccartney jon bon jovi billy joel the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the attacks bowie was back in the studio the following year for reality however in the midst of his reality tour in bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing in germany and underwent emergency surgery in hamburg to clear a blocked artery he took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities in he announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording in february that year he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award having been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in the next day was his first album of new material in a decade it contained the

it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim off doolin pier in county clare ireland where i moved in there was a woman in the water with dusty a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with dusty arrived in doolin in about and hundreds of people have swum with her since giving the impression that shes totally tame she has even starred in an irish touristboard ad campaign in which a girl says she would like to touch a dolphin that evening this woman was tickling dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting there were about tourists and locals on the pier looking at this lovely spectacle just after i got into the water dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic i found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody her tail was flapping wildly and at first i thought it was a display but then i twigged maybe shes angry i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier but within microseconds dusty had ploughed into me with her snout it was very powerful and painful and the speed was amazing i went hurtling forwards all these people on the pier were staring down at me openmouthed dusty was still in the water beside me her tail flapping crazily that was more frightening than anything i thought if she hits me with her tail i could go under im gone i was at the pier but couldnt get out because of my injuries i felt pure terror i shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps then another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma he had been driving into doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier i was so cold and very worried i didnt know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding he checked me over and was very reassuring saying he couldnt feel any evidence of it but that i probably had broken bones i found out later that i had six spinal fractures three broken ribs and a damaged lung i was in hospital for five days in a back brace for several weeks and off work for five months with limited mobility stiffness and pain then i was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress my neardeath experience had left me anxious about everything and overreacting in a way i had never done before i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way i began to struggle with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss three months before the accident i had opened a healthfood shop but i had to let it go because i could no longer work it was the toughest year ever but now its all behind me i had craniosacral therapy osteopathy and massage and am building up my own osteopathy practice now i have a new empathy with patients because i have been one i am grateful that i am healthy and i really want to prevent other people being injured we have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person if you see a ferocious animal coming at you with its teeth bared its scary but dolphins have this lovely wide smile i dont have any anger towards dusty i respect her but i was in her territory and shes a wild unpredictable animal people need to know that so many come here to swim with her and they dont understand how dangerous it can be mine were reportedly among several injuries that summer after the man pulled me out of the water dusty swam away but then she came back and was bobbing vertically next to me looking at me we locked eyes and i felt there was complete remorse in her she was a totally different dolphin the anger had gone the people on the pier were in awe when she had that little moment with me that was the end of the terror i made my peace with her,adv,WNL Experience

it has been called the hotel of mum and dad but few guesthouses have such favourable terms as the housing crisis bites a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep a recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country from just under in the east midlands to more than double that in london where house prices and rents are highest while many around the country contributed financially the survey found that were paying nothing at all young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents which have hit record highs while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder research published by the homeless charity shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit while a quarter could only put by or less each month mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits faced with this young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help the survey found that of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit however it also found that were not saving any money a spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented the hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated our latest research shows rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest and for some moving out may never be an option michael day who lives with his parents in bristol says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between and a month while buying a similar property would cost about i dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its been a bit of a vicious circle day does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited at home he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer he plays golf at county level and he admits that instead of saving he spends his spare cash on golf and holidays you need so much money that i will have to save for

parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their s or s most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rentfree because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner she said children who dont pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home angus hanton cofounder of a thinktank called the intergenerational foundation said older generations were the architects of the housing crisis and children should not be blamed for staying at home the unders have suffered a fall in average incomes of about since the downturn rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buytolet investors who squeeze out the young he said studentfee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer zero hour and shortterm contracts are turning younger workers into secondclass citizens rather than blaming the young we should be standing up for their interests so they can afford to build lives of their own jenna gavin lives in southport merseyside in the family home where she grew up she moved out for a year to go to university but has been living with her parents ever since she works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area but renting a onebedroom flat would cost more than a month before bills which would take up a lot of her earnings i dont want to rent i dont want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end she said ive looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but i just cant borrow enough to get on the property ladder gavin is trying to save but is struggling to amass the necessary funds you dont really see it building up as much as you need even a deposit is such a lot of money and i would like to put down more she said her parents are happy not to charge her rent they want me to try to save up and i contribute in other ways i bring food in and i do things around the house gavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was but she said she had always imagined she would have her own place by

the continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when france appointed its first female professional team manager it did not matter that it was a seconddivision club it did not matter if it was as some bad sports male of course suggested just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team clermont foot currently ranking a lowly th out of in its league what mattered was that helena costa had been given the top job a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional european league as a woman its made me happy vronique soulier president of the clubs supporters association told journalists when i first heard the news i was rather surprised but once that passed we were pretty unanimous that its good news we all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing the new manager of clermont foot whose average home crowd at the stadium at clermont ferrand in the auvergne region of southcentral france is around is a former talent spotter for the scottish premiership side celtic costa was born in alhandra on the river tagus in southeast portugal and graduated with a masters degree in sports science she is also a uefalicensed coach she previously coached benficas male youth teams the qatar womens team which she led to its first international victory in and more recently the iranian womens national side which she left in september costa was appointed on a twoyear contract by the president of clermont foot claude michy who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club in he announced the team had signed messi they had not the argentinian and fc barcelona recordbreaking striker lionel messi but junior messi enguene a yearold midfielder from cameroon frances womens minister najat vallaud belkacem tweeted bravo to clermont foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football carolina morace an italian who was the only previous woman coach of a mens professional team said i dont know helena but if she has been hired by a team then it means that she knows how to do her job i hope that one day this can become normal morace was an outstanding player in the womens game she was the top scorer for seasons in italys serie a and played for italy in internationals in she was named as the coach of viterbese in the mens serie c but after only two games she resigned from the job following a clash with the clubs mercurial proprietor luciano gaucci who at the time was also the owner of a serie a side perugia morace was quoted as saying that she had refused gauccis demand that she fire her deputy and the sides trainer he let me know that i could carry on working with whomever i wanted but by then mutual trust was lacking and i didnt fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty she said morace works today as a lawyer in rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily gazzetta dello sport she said for the time being i see too many men even in the womens game who are working despite not having the same expertise as women who by contrast are not working raymond domenech former manager of the french national team said women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it why shouldnt they manage mens teams the opposite happens and doesnt cause any problems its a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men i say well done to president michy i told myself that if i took charge of a club again id hire a woman as my number two he beat me to it a statement on clermont foot s website said costas appointment would allow the club to enter a new era on the club supporters website reaction to costas appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism in my opinion its just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she wont last the season i find it hard to believe shell be able to get the players respect above all when shes the same age as the oldest wrote one fan her cv isnt bad but now the question is will she be good enough added another a third wrote i wish her welcome and success but i think itll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business has our president pulled off a media coup but soulier was hopeful hopefully with the new manager the club can find the motivation theyre lacking at the moment she said the boys in the team can be difficult to manage with a woman in charge maybe theyll be less demanding if costas reputation is anything to go by she will be the one making the demands after doing work experience at chelsea during her compatriot jos mourinhos first stint as manager of the club between and she was reportedly described as mourinho in a skirt costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch like mourinho i always want to win as far as thats concerned

for years it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system but on july pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the alps or the rockies the extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon charon beamed bn miles back to earth from the new horizons spacecraft mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade alan stern the missions principal investigator described the images as a home run for the team new horizons is returning amazing results already the data look absolutely gorgeous and pluto and charon are just mindblowing one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the kuiper belt the solar systems mysterious third zone where pluto sits amid around smaller icy objects john spencer a mission scientist said the mountains appear to be around ft high and several hundred miles across these are pretty significant mountains the detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater hinting that the surface has been recently paved over by geological activity which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryovolcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock in a nod to plutos former status as the ninth planet until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in the nasa press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets weve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus said dwayne brown nasa spokesman as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled stern described the images as just skimming the surface of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year they have already produced some surprises scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of exotic ices methane and nitrogen you cant make mountains out of methane and nitrogen said spencer water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and thats what we think were seeing here this is the first time weve seen this the methane and nitrogen are just a coating the mountains on pluto are likely to have formed no more than m years ago extremely recently given the bnyearold solar system this suggests the closeup region which covers about of plutos surface may still be geologically active the images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape the structures together with the smoothness of plutos surface suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts scientists believe this paving process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface for scale the images are so detailed that if the craft were flying over london we would be able to pick out the runways at heathrow airport the distance to pluto bn km means it takes new horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take months to send all the data it has accumulated during the flyby the team also announced that the heartshaped feature visible on pluto will now be known as the tombaugh regio in honour of clyde tombaugh who discovered the dwarf planet in the new view of charon reveals a varied complex terrain an area of cliffs and troughs stretching about km suggests widespread fracturing of charons surface which could also be the result of geological activity the image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be to km deep cathy olkin a mission scientist said charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today the team has just been abuzz there is so much interesting science in this one image alone pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice with surface temperatures of about minus c as the m mission travels onwards into the kuiper belt scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets potentially helping to explain the formation of the earth itself andrew coates head of planetary science at the mullard space science laboratory said these kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system theyre all very cold its like a cosmic deep freeze its the best way of preserving solar system history that is what is so fascinating about this its a really thrilling time for solar system exploration in august mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next nasa estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mids then its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond new horizons also observed the smaller members of the pluto system which includes four other moons nix hydra styx and kerberos a new sneakpeek image of hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size estimated to be about by km new horizons is a true mission of exploration showing us why basic scientific research is so important said john grunsfeld associate administrator for nasas science mission directorate the mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to pluto and charon today we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and i can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations the observations also indicate hydras surface is probably coated with water ice future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this and the other moon billions of years ago n,adv,WNL First high resolution images

meeting in san jose california warning that we faced a forgotten generation or even a forgotten century through what he called bit rot where old computer files become useless junk cerf called for the development of digital vellum to preserve old software and hardware so that outofdate files could be recovered no matter how old they are when you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form like our interactions by email peoples tweets and all of the world wide web its clear that we stand to lose an awful lot of our history he said we dont want our digital lives to fade away if we want to preserve them we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered far into the future he added what is bit rot and is vint cerf right to be worried being able to access digital content in the coming decades could be less of an issue than one of the fathers of the internet has implied the warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology where music photos letters and other documents are digitized in the hope of ensuring their longterm survival but while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries the programs and hardware needed to make sense of the files are continually falling out of use we are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it we digitize things because we think we will preserve them but what we dont understand is that unless we take other steps those digital versions may not be any better and may even be worse than the artefacts that we digitized cerf says if there are photos you really care about print them out ancient civilizations suffered no such problems because histories written in cuneiform on baked clay tablets or rolled papyrus scrolls needed only eyes to read them to study todays culture future scholars would be faced with pdfs word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with dedicated software and sometimes hardware too the problem is already here in the s it was routine to save documents on floppy disks upload jet set willy from cassette to the zx spectrum slaughter aliens with a quickfire ii joystick and have atari games cartridges in the attic even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums the rise of gaming has its own place in the story of digital culture but cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot in american historian doris kearns goodwin wrote team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln describing how lincoln hired those who ran against him for presidency she went to libraries around the us found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations in todays world those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be vanishingly small one hundred years from now said cerf he concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by todays standards but argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later historians have learned how the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in bc after the archimedes palimpsest was found hidden under the words of a byzantine prayer book from the thirteenth century weve been surprised by what weve learned from objects that have been preserved purely by chance that give us insights into an earlier civilization he said researchers at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh have made headway towards a solution to bit rot or at least a partial one there mahadev satyanarayanan takes digital snapshots of computer hard drives while they run different software programs these can then be uploaded to a computer that mimics the one the software ran on the result is a computer that can read otherwise defunct files under a project called olive the researchers have archived mystery house

the end of the decade the neighbours are selling up their own stately home while lord grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that underbutlers are no longer affordable but at the real downton abbey highclere castle a stately home owned by george geordie herbert th earl of carnarvon the financial outlook has rarely been brighter according to lady fiona carnarvon the huge global success of downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding highclere for the next generation its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us she said its given us a wonderful marketing platform an international profile im hugely grateful my husband and i love the house and the people here now without doubt it is loved by millions of other people currently only the ground and first floors of highclere on the borders of hampshire are used but a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the houses of parliament sir charles barry who rebuilt the house between and when the downton abbey producers first approached highclere in the family faced a near m repair bill with urgent work priced at m but by the downton effect had begun to take the pressure off lord carnarvon said then it was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions we had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that then downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction visitor numbers doubled to a day as downton abbey scripted by julian fellowes came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the uk in and then in the us it is now broadcast in countries the formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission the accounts of highclere enterprises for show current assets have almost trebled to around m since gareth neame the executive producer for the series said i think downton abbey secured highcleres future peter fincham itvs director of television recalls the moment when highclere was booked i thought so what because i had never heard of highclere castle one stately home looks much the same as another how wrong i was the castle has been one enormous character as well the downton

embassies neame said they approached me because of the reach a lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment in other parts of the world people revere our actors our writing and production talent it is something i am passionate about i am a really strong believer in soft power we are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be downton abbey is iconic for expressing britishness really it is a fantasy world based in a particular time in history its the first tv period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture lady carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the longterm future of highclere is not necessarily secure the bottom line is quite thin she said the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings have the follies restored in the pipeline is a tutankhamun centenary event in years after the th earl of carnarvon together with howard carter discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of egyptology another opportunity to keep highclere in the public mind is the th anniversary of the birth of lancelot capability brown who designed the grounds what you do is never sit on your laurels every single day dont take anything for granted said lady carnarvon for all these great houses you have to invest in them and there has been a deficit since the s perhaps in the past an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but today it is quite the reverse the challenge is how geordie and i seek to support and look after highclere from my point of view ive tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with not just a wander around a dusty house we have to compete with attractions like the london dungeonn,adv,WNL How downtown

passing clouds one of the pleasures of flying is seeing clouds close up even though they seem insubstantial they carry a considerable weight of water around tonnes in a small cumulus cloud and water is denser than air so why dont clouds fall out of the sky like rain they do but the droplets take a long time to sink an average cloud would take a year to fall one metre on cloud nine most of us are happy to label clouds fluffy ones or nasty black ones but meteorologists identify more than cloud types based on shape and altitude these fit into categories given numbers from one to nine cloud nine is the vast towering cumulonimbus so to be on cloud nine implies being on top of the world around the rainbow theres no better place to see a rainbow than from a plane rainbows are produced when sunlight hits raindrops we see a bow because the earth gets in the way but from a plane a rainbow is a complete circle when passing over clouds the planes shadow appears neatly in the centre of the effect mr blue sky sunlight is white containing all the colours of the spectrum but as it passes through air some of the light is scattered when it interacts with the gas molecules blue light scatters more than the lowerenergy colours so the blue appears to come from the sky theres life out there apart from clouds and other planes we dont expect to see much directly outside a flying aircrafts window but the air is seething with bacterial life as many as different types of bacteria have been detected over cities and they can reach twice the cruising height of a plane turbulence terror even the most experienced flyer can be turned green by turbulence the outcome can be anything from repeated bumping to sudden dramatic plunges the good news for nervous flyers is that no modern airliner has ever been brought down by turbulence people have been injured and occasionally killed when they are not strapped in or get struck by poorly secured luggage but the plane is not going to be knocked out of the sky inflight radiation when body scanners were introduced at airports there were radiation scares but the level produced is the same as passengers receive in one minute of flight the earth is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays natural radiation from space that has more impact at altitude you cant cure jet lag the world is divided into time zones the result is that longhaul travel results in a difference between local time and your bodys time causing jet lag however its effects can be minimized by keeping food bland for hours before travel drinking plenty of fluids and living on your destination time from the moment you reach the aircraft supersonic s many of us have travelled faster than sound there are a number of jet streams in the upper atmosphere notably on the journey from the us to europe where a temperature inversion causes a corridor of air to move as fast as mph if an airliner with an airspeed of mph enters a jet stream the result can be to fly at mph above sounds mph flying through time time zones provide an artificial journey through time but special relativity means that a flight involves actual time travel its so minimal though that crossing the atlantic weekly for years would only move you th of a second into the future terrible tea dont blame the cabin attendant if your tea isnt great water should be just under c when it is poured on to tea leaves but that isnt possible on a plane its impossible to get water beyond c during flight so choose coffee i cant hear my food airline food has a reputation for being bland and tasteless some of the problem may not be poor catering though a plane is a noisy environment and there is evidence that food loses some of its savour when we are exposed to loud noises needle in a haystack with modern technology it seems strange that malaysian flight mh could disappear without a trace yet finding a missing aircraft is a needle inahaystack problem the plane knows its location both from gps and inertial tracking but this information is not relayed elsewhere in real time that would be perfectly possible ocean going ships have had tracking since the s the limitation is not technology but a lack of legislation requiring it volcanic fallout air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity glasslike ash particles melt in the heat of the engine then solidify on the rotors a clearskies policy in an ash cloud may be inconvenient but the risks of ignoring the ash are clear the wing myth for many years we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air in fact almost all a planes lift comes from newtons third law of motion the wing is shaped to push air downwards as the air is pushed down the wing gets an equal and opposite push upwards lifting the plane forget electric planes when we see ultralight experimental electric planes its easy to assume there will soon be clean green electric airliners but it wont happen any time soon aircraft fuel packs in a remarkable amount of energy batteries are much less efficient to provide the same energy as a tonne of fuel would take tonnes of batteries and a uses to tonnes of fuel unless battery technology is made vastly more efficient electric airliners wont get off the ground beware the vortex pilots often wait a long time to get clearance this is to allow the air to settle after a previous takeoff as a planes wingtips generate vortices in the air which can take two or three minutes to disperse if the following aircraft set off immediately the rapidly moving air would make the plane difficult to handle the delay gives the air time to recover from the miniature whirlwinds caused by the preceding plane the doors arent locked in practice the doors on a plane dont need to be locked if you watch an aircraft door being opened it swings in an unusual way it first has to be opened inwards before manoeuvring it out of the way once the plane has taken off a significant pressure difference soon builds up between the inside of the plane and the outside this differential forces the door into place to open it you would have to pull against the air pressure well beyond the capabilities of human musclesn,adv,WNL In flight

the last time she took to the stage the prototype of the mobile phone was undergoing its first trials thirtyfive years later as she performs once again singer kate bush is faced with a different world while most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets bush is taking a stand against fans watching her shows through the digital veil of a screen prior to her highly anticipated series of concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london bush released a statement appealing to her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs bush wrote on her website i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows we have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium it would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows i very much want to have contact with you as an audience not with iphones ipads or cameras i know its a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together with her love of theatrics and opulent costumes bushs keenness to stop fans uploading grainy footage to youtube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have purchased tickets for the dates she is playing bush is not the first to speak out against the detrimental effect of the presence of phones at concerts with numerous artists berating their fans for experiencing live music through the filter of a screen the who front man roger daltrey recently said it was weird that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage he said i feel sorry for them i really feel sorry for them looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally if youre doing that youre there right its weird i find it weird in beyonc berated one of her fans at a gig for filming you cant even sing because youre too busy taping beyonc told him im right in your face baby you gotta seize this moment put that damn camera down the debate around the presence of phones at live events is not restricted to music with sport fans equally vocal on the subject recently dutch fans at psv eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wifi in their stadium holding up banners with messages like no wifi support the team you can sit at home and stand united while manchester united have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home prohibiting filming on tablets this season jarvis cocker has previously criticized phone wielders in the audience for driving him insane at concerts adding it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than the size of a cigarette packet johnny marr said in that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to document the event for later to stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity you know i dont mean to be unkind but i think you should put your phone down because youre just being an idiot really just enjoy the gig he said thats one of the things about gigs its taking in whats going on with the people around you and watching it on a little screen its a waste of time the yeah yeah yeahs resorted to putting up a sign at one of their venues pleading with fans to pocket their technology it read please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart devicecamera put it away as a courtesy to the person behind you and to the band it has even filtered into the world of classical music with one of the worlds leading pianists surprising concertgoers in june when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone krystian zimerman returned moments later and declared the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous but sam watt of vyclone a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowdsourced video of the event said that such artists were fighting a losing battle and that filming at concerts enhanced rather than detracted from the experience fans filming is now part of the concert experience that is a just a fact so we take that footage that people are filming at concerts through the app they upload it onto the app and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming you end up with really fantastic content he said our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience rather than taking away from it and i think if kate bush came round for a cup of tea we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round he added knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important because it is probably going to hit them on the head in the future if they say to everyone they cant film youve

cities dont often decide to pack their bags get up and move down the road but thats exactly what kiruna an arctic town in northern sweden is having to do to avoid being swallowed up into the earth its a dystopian choice says krister lindstedt of white the stockholmbased architects firm charged with the biblical task of moving this city of people away from a gigantic ironore mine that is fast gobbling up the ground beneath its streets either the mine must stop digging creating mass unemployment or the city has to move or else face certain destruction its an existential predicament founded in by the stateowned luossavaarakiirunavaara mining company lk kiruna has grown rich off the vast seam of iron ore below the town but its now facing destruction by the very phenomenon that created its wealth we are symbiotic the town is here because of the mine says deputy mayor niklas siren otherwise no devil would have built a city here located km inside the arctic circle kiruna is subject to a brutal climate enduring winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below c but the deep deposit of magnetite has proved a strong enough magnet to keep people here driven by the insatiable global appetite for construction the mine has become the worlds largest underground ironore extraction site producing of all the iron in europe enough to build more than six eiffel towers a day and demand continues to grow in the mining company broke it to the town that its days were numbered digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of degrees subsidence would soon lead to the widespread cracking and collapse of the towns buildings a decade on fissures are starting to appear in the ground creeping ever closer to the town the people of kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years says viktoria walldin a social anthropologist who works with the architects they have put their lives on hold unable to make major decisions like buying a house redecorating having a child or opening a business after years of dithering the city has finally unveiled a master plan for how it will proceed imagine it like a walking millipede of a city says lindstedt unrolling a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street until the whole place has moved safely out of the way of the mine by a new town square is already under way km to the east with a circular town hall planned by danish architect henning larsen while key buildings have been identified to be dismantled and resurrected piece by piece in their new home like an ikea flatpack on a grand scale kirunas rustred wooden church built in in a form that recalls the indigenous sami teepees and once voted swedens most beautiful building will take pride of place in a new park while the cast iron bell tower will stand once again above the town hall but not everything will be saved i spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss says walldin its things like that the hospital where your first child was born for example that are important to peoples sense of identity and all thats going to disappear billed as the most democratic move in history the project has been allocated the equivalent of m by the mining company for building new facilities including a high school fire station community centre library and swimming hall but top of most peoples concerns is where they will actually live and what process will determine the housing allocation these details have yet to be determined admits lindstedt people are used to very low rents and very high incomes but in future this will have to change lk has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus but many locals say this is not enough to afford a newbuild house at market rates to aid the valuation process the architects have monitored the housing lettings in nearby cities over a period of years and tagged the homes in kiruna with the assets they possess from internal space and gardens to proximity to bus stops and the city centre they have also proposed a kiruna portal a kind of mass salvage yard where materials from the doomed homes can be brought and hopefully recycled in the construction of the new buildings although given that sweden has no tradition of selfbuild its hard to see this taking off a closer look at the plan shows the new town bears little relation to the original kiruna at all the current town is a sprawling suburban network of winding streets home to detached houses with gardens whites plan incorporates a much higherdensity arrangement of multistorey apartment blocks around shared courtyards lining straight boulevards down which the icy winds will surge it is an opportunity say the architects for kiruna to reinvent itself into a model of sustainable development attracting young people who wouldnt have stayed in the town before with new cultural facilities and visionary things such as a cable car bobbing above the high street but it is a vision that many of the existing residents seem unlikely to be able to afford n,adv,WNL Kiruna

loneliness has finally become a hot topic the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest country in europe british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than residents anywhere else in the eu and a relatively high proportion of them have no one to rely on in a crisis meanwhile research by professor john cacioppo at the university of chicago has found loneliness to be twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty but shocking as this is such studies overlook the loneliness epidemic among younger adults in the mental health foundation found loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than the elderly the to yearolds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the overs loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly there are day centres and charities to help them says

loneliness and mental health it is linked to increased stress depression paranoia anxiety addiction cognitive decline and is a known factor in suicide in a new essay paul farmer the chief executive of

blank a survey research fellow at the oxford internet institute points out that social media and the internet can be a boon and a problem they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace facetoface contact people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media says challis comparing friends seemingly perfect lives with ours can lead us to withdraw socially while meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems theyre not necessarily helpful for loneliness as they actively encourage us to dwell alone on our thoughts youd be better off addressing the underlying causes of being lonely first whats stopping you going out and seeing people asks challis indeed a study of social media at the university of michigan in found that while facebook reduces life satisfaction using

for counselling and psychotherapys bacp lead adviser for the workplace we treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our wellbeing says nicky forsythe a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health a social enterprise that trains people to give and receive peer support in groups the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener for developing personal skills such as empathy counselling can help the bacp website allows you to search for counsellors in your area a problem aired is a problem shared and sometimes you need to talk to someone impartial and independent of your friends and family says hughes most universities offer students such counselling and many run group sessions that specifically address loneliness if recent research is to be believed loneliness is killing the elderly and with an ageing population we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late getting

a nasal spray laced with the love hormone oxytocin could help children with autism learn to handle social situations better us researchers claim scans of children with autistic spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions a shift that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them the scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations over time what you would expect to see is more appropriate social responding being more interested in interacting with other people more eye contact and more conversational ability said kevin pelphrey director of the child neuroscience lab at yale university autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in people the condition affects individuals in different ways but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication so far there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a potential treatment for the social impairments caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in bonding and trust results have been mixed though one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially he said our study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens up the possibility that when combined with behavioural treatments it works like a social enhancer he said the scientists used a technique called functional mri to scan the brains of youths aged eight to with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing various emotions the scans were given minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray the scans showed that reward circuitry in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars the study appears in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences in the united states if this is replicated it suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we dont have a treatment in autism and thats the core social motivation pelphrey told the guardian he warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online we dont want them running out on the basis of this study or any other and trying oxytocin at home there is no telling what they are buying we are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment it needs more followup he said this is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration said simon baroncohen director of the autism research centre at cambridge university a surprising finding however is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects finally oxytocin effects only last about minutes so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment from a scientific perspective this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention but more research is needed doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks in much larger studies said simon baroncohen uta frith who studies autism at university college london said according to this study oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation disappointingly this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value n,adv,WNL Love hormonw

he is the star of one of the worlds longest running and most successful film series with movies and more than bn amassed at the global box office but james bond shows no signs of slowing down in fact the bond brand is stronger than ever after the recordbreaking performance of skyfall which became the biggest ever film at the uk box office on its release in and with its total earnings of bn currently stands in ninth place of alltime largest earners hence the intense interest that surrounded the announcement of a few more details of the th bond film not the least its official title spectre the number one question is this can spectre repeat the skyfall trick will skyfall remain a high water mark for the bond movie or can spectre extend this winning run charles gant film editor for heat magazine says the indications are it is heading in the right direction skyfall was a brilliant strategic move he says it was cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern and retro it appealed to the danielcraigera fans who are relative newcomers to the franchise and it also managed to engage the older more nostalgic elements of the audience who may have lost interest over the previous few films with the new title he adds they are already on to a winner my feeling is that spectre announces that they want to hang on to the nostalgic more agediverse bond fan as well as retaining the younger audience the initial signs are that eon productions the company originally founded in to make dr no and that is behind all the official bonds is doing its utmost to ensure lightning strikes twice by installing the key creative talent behind skyfall on spectre daniel craig has been tied down at least until bond while the same writers have produced the script but its the recapture of director sam mendes that gives bondwatchers the most hope a director principally known for character studies such as american beauty and revolutionary road mendes has taken the bond series to new heights gant says mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional bond audience and he also pulled in highcalibre actors like ralph fiennes to get actors like fiennes in they have to be happy with the director among other achievements skyfall virtually doubled the box office of its predecessor quantum of solace which managed a worldwide figure of m on its release in no one is expecting anything like that this time but eon will not be complacent though the bond series was not in trouble before mendess arrival and craigs there was the sense of a certain amount of staleness towards the end of pierce brosnans run the series had survived the drying up of actual bond stories to adapt the movies having long since departed from any resemblance to the ian fleming originals but it was lacking a certain dynamism this cycle however was nothing new the history of the bond series has been one of ebb and flow stasis and renewal revolving most obviously around the lead actor first sean connery then successively george lazenby roger moore timothy dalton brosnan and now craig each appointment has been a response to the state of the series and some have worked out better than others lazenby only lasted a single film while daltons two efforts the living daylights and licence to kill coincided with a period in the late s when the movie had been thoroughly eclipsed by more aggressive slickly produced hollywood action movies according to gant the period of roger moores last ones going into dalton didnt really excite audiences brosnan saw a bit of an upturn commercially while craig has taken it to new levels on the other hand the early bonds were incredibly commercial films sexy and exciting and there was very little around like them its a point worth underlining that although skyfalls actual receipts dwarf all the other bond films the performance of some of the s entries in the series was almost as brilliant by comparison with figures adjusted for inflation the release thunderball is only a hairs breadth below skyfall while goldfinger and you only live twice both outperformed the other craig films as did the s bonds the spy who loved me and live and let die by this reckoning licence to kill is the worstperforming of all bonds with moores final effort a view to a kill in secondtolast place nevertheless the bond brand has remained immensely powerful over the decades with eon being forced to fend off attempts by rival outfits to capitalize on the seriess popularity through a quirk of rights ownership adaptations of casino royale in and thunderball as never say never again in were released in competition with eon productions although subject to legal disputes over several decades eon now has full control of both books casino royale whose rights had been individually sold off by fleming in eventually passed to eon in as a result of an agreement between eons backers mgm and rival hollywood studio sony thereby clearing the way for the version thunderball on the other hand owed its disputed status to writerproducer kevin mcclory who helped fleming outline the original story and who claimed ownership of the novel over subsequent decades and produced never say never again as a result after mcclorys death in his family eventually settled with mgm and eons parent company in november if the initial surge of enthusiasm for bond movies lasted through the s and into the s its fair to say that the series almost ground to a halt after licence to kills poor figures goldeneye the first of brosnans efforts heralded a dramatic renewal not simply because of a new actor but more significantly because of who was behind the camera however after a sixyear break eon installed martin campbell in the chair another experienced british director but one who was able to orchestrate one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history the justly renowned opening scene of goldeneye during which bond freefalls into the cockpit of a pilotless light aeroplane did much to reinvigorate and modernize the series on its own moreover a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful goldeneye videogame spinoff making a significant contribution to perceptions that the bond film was no longer stale and oldfashioned,adv,WNL Making a killing

benjamin carle is made in france right down to his underpants and socks unfortunately six ikea forks a chinese guitar and unsourced wall paint stopped him being declared a economic patriot but nobody is perfect carle set out in to see if it was possible to live using only frenchmade products for ten months as part of a television documentary the idea was triggered by the minister for economic renewal arnaud montebourgs call for the public to buy french to save the countrys industrial production sector the experiment cost carle his smartphone television refrigerator all made in china his spectacles italian his underpants moroccan morning coffee guatemalan and his adored david bowie music british fortunately his longsuffering girlfriend anas and cat loon both french stuck with him politicians say all sorts of things and expect us to go along with it i wanted to see if it was possible and feasible to do what the minister was asking us to do to hold him to account for his words carle told the guardian over a nonfrench coffee in a parisian caf after finishing his documentary he set just three rules eat only foods produced in france eliminate contact with foreignmade goods and do so on a month above the minimum wage of to cover the extra expense of living in paris the journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only of the contents of his flat were made nationally and that the rest would have to go including the lightbulbs china and green beans kenya the removal men left his home almost bare left without a refrigerator none are made in france or nail clippers he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge and saw at his toenails with a penknife his foreignmade clothes down to his underwear were replaced with more expensive alternatives frenchproduced underpants socks polo shirt espadrille sandals but no jeans as none are produced in france during the experiment carle scoured supermarket shelves for frenchmade products learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in france proudly brushed his teeth with the last toothbrush made in france by a company in picardie employing people and handwashed his smalls until he found the last frenchmade washing machine which being top opening would not fit under the kitchen counter going out with friends was problematic no american films no belgian beer no sushi or pizza staying home with no sofa for the first few months and no television meant listening to crooner michel sardou and reading french novels french wine was of course allowed and frenchcanadian singer cline dion but not according to his advisers french bands such as daft punk who sing in english unable to use his britishmade bicycle or even a french car after discovering the only affordable peugeot renault and citron models are mostly made overseas he invested in a fugemitting orange mobylette moped the last things to go were the computer replaced by a qooq a recipe tablet that connects slowly to the internet and the iphone swapped for an old sagem mobile the documentary shows carle realizing he is addicted to his iphone smashing it with a brandnew frenchmade tefal saucepan while his girlfriend shrieks are you crazy those are new pans carle tells viewers his aim is to save the french economy after all i like mission impossible he admits the experiment was part serious and part jest at one point he consults a french language expert to check if he should be using cool and other anglicisms he was advised to swap it for the nearest french equivalent chouette on discovering france makes no refrigerators apart from wine coolers or televisions but is big in aeroplane seats and windmills he sighs and says great nothing that will fit into my apartment at the end of the experiment carle takes out a bank loan to refurnish his home and clothe himself a special auditor declares him made in france and montebourg visits to present him with a medal carles conclusion its not entirely possible or even desirable to live made in france particularly in terms of new technology but that wasnt the point this wasnt about french nationalism or patriotism it was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we consume and make different choices and that applies in all countries if we want to save jobs and industries wherever we are we might think about supporting them a tshirt is more expensive in france but i can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions i cannot be sure about a cheaper tshirt produced in asia or morocco he added its hypocrisy to go around blaming capitalists for a countrys economic decline when people could be doing more as consumers carle says he hopes to continue supporting french industry and producers but not it is a fulltime job just finding the stuff he said the first thing he did when the experiment ended was invite his friends around for the evening to enjoy a plate of cheese and listen to the david bowie album aladdin sane it was difficult not being able to invite people around because there was nowhere to sit but id choose the bowie over a sofa any day,adv,WNL Man

why do it talking to the men earmarked to be the elite referees of the future the question elicits a knowing smile this season criticism of referees has increased to the point where some former referees have felt compelled to complain about standards that is quite striking because the more you talk to referees the more obvious it is that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental so why do it why spend countless hours driving up and down the country to dole out rules some of which are inevitably going to upset people trying to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions who scrutinize you and your ability with the aid of umpteen different angles and slowmotion replays a glimpse of an answer appears on the face of lee swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a win for grimsby over woking a match at level of the english league system he gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match twentytwo handshakes he explains afterwards proudly symbolically a full set of handshakes plus a well done from both managers represents maximum satisfaction the buzz as he calls it of a game that passes smoothly is something he loves i wouldnt spend so much time away from my family if this didnt mean the world to me as one of the group that is highly regarded by the professional game match officials limited pgmol for his potential swabey knew he was being watched at that match pgmols chief mike riley was in attendance along with steve dunn who is the coach for this level armed with notes and stopwatch to catalogue every significant move the officials make a few weeks earlier riley dunn and another former referee peter jones made their way to another level match to monitor another referee tipped to progress john brooks i hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the premier league and officiate some of the top games in this country brooks says the most the pgmol delegation got to observe however was the way brooks handled the somewhat tricky situation of calling off the match because of a frozen pitch it is all part of the experience brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more highprofile games the different problems that need dealing with often clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have turned up but will not receive any gate money brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision a little later the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level is so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash brooks like swabey has clear ambitions to progress he is under no illusions that developing a thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with disappointments is a big part of that how does he feel watching football on tv when a referee gets vilified erm not great he admits ive been in that situation once where i have made an incorrect decision and it was a deciding goal that was just offside your heart sinks you cant stop thinking about it i do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in it is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right in certain situations you are going to be unpopular but if you are uncomfortable with that you are probably in the wrong job the former referees agree that the backup education and tools that todays referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days riley as a young referee went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all contrast this with brooks who has a coach at the end of the phone they consult weekly discuss how his games have gone study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve he also has the support of a sports psychologist liam slack for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the km he runs during a game brooks says psychology is vital in his development one of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on he explains there may be a big decision to make in the first seconds of the game once you have made that you need to stay focused for the next minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision liam has taught us some techniques for releasing that decision working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness jones believes the whole approach can only help i refereed in professional football but looking back i was an amateur he says i was going to work i worked for british telecom and i might referee at newcastle on a wednesday evening and am the next morning i was in leicester trying to speak to customers i perhaps hadnt slept training was ad hoc we were amateurs in a professional environment compared to now when the subject of technology comes up the three former refs are unanimous in their support of it we are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play says riley minimizing mistakes is the aim after all a bad decision can stick with you for a while the rest of your life notes jones with a chucklen,adv,WNL Men in

a mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on earth researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with powerhungry cooling systems around of the energy used by buildings in the us goes on air conditioning but the researchers calculations suggest that in some cases the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling in a rooftop comparison of the device in stanford california scientists found that while a surface painted black reached c more than ambient temperature in sunlight and bare aluminium reached c more the mirror was up to c cooler than the surrounding air temperature if you cover significant parts of the roof with this mirror you can see how much power it can save you can significantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning said shanhui fan an expert in photonics at stanford university who led the development of the mirror in some situations the computations say you can completely offset the air conditioning buildings warm up in a number of different ways hotwater boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings in hot countries warm air comes in through doors and windows then there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun which also heat up buildings the stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects of the visible light that falls on it but more importantly it works as a thermal radiator when the mirror is warmed up it releases heat at a specific wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space to make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink somewhere to dump unwanted heat the heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job for example a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid the stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink the universe itself the mirror is built from several layers of waferthin materials the first layer is reflective silver on top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide these layers improve the reflectivity but also turn the mirror into a thermal radiator when silicon dioxide heats up it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength the heat passes straight out to space the total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre the cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource even during the hottest hours of the day the scientists write in nature in tests the mirror had a cooling power of watts per square metre at ambient temperature writing in the journal fan puts the installed cost of mirrors at between and per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of mwh on a threestorey building fan said that the mirror could cool buildings or other objects simply by putting it in direct contact with them coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior more likely the mirror would be used to cool water or some other fluid that would then be pumped around the building he ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming roof space accounts for only a small portion of the earths surface so at this point we dont think this would be a geoengineering solution rather our contribution on the greenhousegasemission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption he said im really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling said marin soljai a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology you could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all you could put it on top of shopping malls with a large enough surface you could get substantial coolingn n,adv,WNL Mirrors

the moroccan city of ouarzazate is used to big productions on the edge of the sahara desert and at the centre of the north african countrys ouallywood film industry it has played host to bigbudget location shots in lawrence of arabia the mummy the living daylights and even game of thrones now the trading city nicknamed the door of the desert is the location for another blockbuster a complex of four linked solar megaplants which alongside hydro and wind will help provide nearly half of moroccos electricity from renewables by with it is hoped some spare to export to europe the project is a key plank in moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower when the full complex is complete it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the first phase called noor will go live in november the mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down the potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades in the days after the chernobyl nuclear accident in the german particle physicist gerhard knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanitys power needs for a whole year the challenge though has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required as engineers put the finishing touches to noor its crescentshaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline the rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east when they are finished the four plants

environment minister hakima elhaite believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last but the bn project to make her countrys deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns she said we are not an oil producer we import of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget elhaite told the guardian we also used to subsidize fossil fuels which have a heavy cost so when we heard about the potential of solar energy we thought why not solar energy will make up a third of moroccos renewable energy supply by with wind and hydro taking the same share each we are very proud of this project elhaite said i think it is the most important solar plant in the world each parabolic mirror is metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a heat transfer solution htf that is warmed to c as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine there it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy generating turbines the htf is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours allowing the plant to power homes into the night the mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds technicians say that the noor and plants due to open in will store energy for up to eight hours opening the prospect of solar energy in the sahara and the surrounding region the biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve said rashid albayad the project director but even as the first phase of the project nears completion morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions we are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of morocco and mauritania as a first step says ahmed baroudi manager of socit dinvestissements energtiques the national renewable energy investment firm but he says the projects ultimate impact will go far wider even as far as the middle east the ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is mecca whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries according to the moroccan solar energy agency masen talks are ongoing with tunisia and energy exports northwards across the mediterranean remain a key goal we believe that its possible to export energy to europe but first we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist said maha elkadiri a masen spokeswoman specifically we would have to build interconnections which would not go through the existing one in spain and then start exporting spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to france the eu has set a target of ensuring that of each member countrys power can be transported abroad by cable by in the meantime morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence this could one day include water desalination in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the middle east and north african region we are at the avantegarde of solar elkadiri says about bn has been invested in the noor complex much of it from international institutions such as the european investment bank and world bank and backed by moroccan government guarantees undisclosed energy subsidies from moroccos unelected ruler king mohammed vi have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers one

the customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough but instead of a shopping list you notice shes carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store shes been timing the progression of the queue on her phone and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse the odds are youve just spotted a mystery shopper there are approximately mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the uk according to the mystery shopping providers association and as more and more spending takes place online the demand for mystery shoppers is growing retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online says simon boydell spokesman for marketforce which has more than mystery shoppers on its books our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience we assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months says jill spencer of mystery shopping company aba each day they typically spend up to eight hours visiting five to ten stores plus another hour or two filing detailed reports on every aspect of their visit for that the mystery shoppers can earn up to a day they are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays and compensated for their car depreciation the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as miles a year meanwhile video mystery shoppers who film their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag can earn even more around a day shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy im typically given between and to spend at each store to assess the service i receive at the till says laura a yearold mystery shopper from devon who has been paid to visit around shops since the purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check im always given a scenario such as buying something from a specific department or a new product range but within that framework i can often buy whatever i want and keep it like most fulltime mystery shoppers laura is selfemployed taking jobs from aba and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up her income is typically to a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job with the perks its enough to live on but i dont do it because i love shopping in fact i hate shopping now when im not working it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk she does however find it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved i know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it some of the retailers i shop at win awards for customer service and i think that is down to us mystery shoppers i feel im not just doing a service to my company im doing a service to all shoppers everywhere sadly regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like lauras are few and far between in fact competition is so fierce she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family dont know who she works for laura is not her real name its estimated that more than people have registered as mystery shoppers in the uk but just or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation where once you got a fee reimbursement for your purchase and mileage you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase say val a yearold former mystery shopper i worked for different mystery shopping companies for almost years but i gave up entirely three years ago because i had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what i considered to be an acceptable rate nowadays mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort says boydell at the most well pay to plus reimbursement for say a meal for two or a hotel stay we dont directly employ any shoppers so we dont have to pay them the minimum wage id go on a cruise for nothing says laura but i think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people i wont touch those jobs anymore there are plenty of people however that would hannah a yearold city lawyer has conducted nearly visits for the mystery dining company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses as a prestigious platinum diner she is regularly handpicked by the mystery dining company to carry out their most exclusive assignments enjoying meals at michelinstarred mayfair restaurants fivestar hospitality at ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels but theres no such thing as a free lunch even if you work for a mystery dining company hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to specific interactions with staff whom she always needs to be able to name or subtly describe trickiest of all she must memorize all these details while eating her meal unable of course to openly write anything down theres lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience youre expected to give feedback while its fresh so ive had to get up at am to write a report before work its a challenging thing to do you need to be focused articulate and detail orientatedn,adv,WNL Mystery Shopper

himalayan lakes spacewalks and the presidential primaries helped scott kelly keep his wits over days in space the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on earth from a recordsetting mission it seemed like i lived there forever kelly said the veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt maybe occasionally you do go bananas he said kelly and a russian counterpart mikhail kornienko spent nearly a year on the international space station iss in order to study the effects of weightlessness radiation and the cramped quarters of spaceflight on humans research nasa considers essential for an eventual mission to mars kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt significantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips kelly and his twin brother mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests the tests will continue to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of spaceflight kelly said he felt aches and had extremely sensitive skin but so far his balance has felt mostly decent however he said the first thing i tried to throw on a table i missed because you tend to underestimate the effects of gravity he said the discomfort of returning to gravity which shrank him back down to normal height after he stretched by inches in orbit took nothing away from the awe he felt after his capsule landed back on earth when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan kelly said he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area it was the fresh air mingled with the charred kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived reentry through the atmosphere backing away from the vessel he said the scope of the mission began to sink in days on a yearold space station which is a million pounds the size of a football field the internal volume some say of a sixbedroom house the iss he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers there are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now kelly said comparing the research of more than missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the s and s he added the view is great too kelly made the most of that view posting spectacular photos on social media of the earths cities landscapes oceans and atmosphere the earth is a beautiful planet he said describing the striking colours of the waters around the bahamas and the rainbow hues of lakes that dot the northern himalayas he said he would like to visit that region though he would first need to learn what country actually owns them but predominantly you just notice how thin the atmosphere is how fragile it looks kelly added that combined with these large swathes of pollution is kind of alarming the astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution smoke clouds from wildfires that covered parts of the us sections of asia with continuous visible pollution nearly all year round he said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point the planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment the worlds thin shield of atmosphere makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down he said its for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it if we make the decision to kellys active social media life which he said was a joint effort with his girlfriend earned him a huge online following but he said he was unaware of it instead he was watching the chaotic drama of the presidential election one of the first questions he asked the crew who lifted him out of a space capsule was how did super tuesday go but the astronaut demurred when asked for his thoughts on the likes of donald trump and bernie sanders i would say that as a government employee i am subject to the hatch act he said referring to a law that prohibits some political activity for federal employees so i cant say how i think of all the news stories of all the year besides the news he said steady work helped keep him sane i tried to have milestones that were close like when is the next crew arriving the next spacewalk the next robotics the next science experiment that made a difference to me keeping my sanity being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in he added recalling how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission therell be a point here pretty soon where ill start feeling that kind of culture shock he said although a nasa scientist said kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to mars the astronaut himself predicted that he would not fly again with the space agency but i dont think i would ever say im absolutely done he added noting the sudden successes of private spaceflight companies such as spacex they might need a guy like me someday he said maybe in the next years youll be able to buy a

astronaut scott kelly has just spent days in space he says that himalayan lakes spacewalks and the us presidential campaign helped him to stay sane during his mission it was the longest mission ever it seemed like i lived there forever kelly said he had been on several missions before but said that his biggest surprise was how long this mission felt maybe sometimes you go bananas he saidn kelly and a russian astronaut mikhail kornienko spent nearly a year on the international space station iss they studied the effects on humans of weightlessness radiation and the cramped conditions of spaceflight this is research that nasa thinks is very important for a future mission to marsn kelly said the length of the mission was the most difficult thing he felt more pain after he returned to gravity than after shorter trips kelly and his twin brother mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests the tests will continue to help nasa learn about what happens to the human body during spaceflight kelly described the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth when the russian capsule opened he felt the cool air of kazakhstan and smelled a smell like a plant was blooming in that area it was the fresh air mixed with the burnt sweet smell of a spacecraft that had just re entered through the earths atmospheren when he left the spacecraft he said he began to understand the importance of the mission days on a yearold space station which is a million pounds the size of a football field with the space some say of a sixbedroom house the iss he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and an international team helped to build it the view is great too he saidn kelly posted amazing photos on social media of the earth s cities countryside oceans and atmosphere the earth is a beautiful planet he said he described the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas but the main thing you notice is how thin the atmosphere is kelly said it is scary to see the thin atmosphere together with large areas of pollutionn he said he could see large areas of pollution smoke clouds from wildfires cover parts of the us parts of asia have pollution nearly all year he said the message we need to save the planet was slightly wrong the planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment we must take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink and i believe we do have a big effect on that and we have the ability to change it if we want to kelly was very active on social media so many people follow him online but he said he didnt know about it instead he watched the news and especially the us presidential campaign the news helped keep him sane he said and also work i looked forward to the next event for example the next spacewalk the next science experiment that made a difference to me being back on earth with everyone still felt strange he saidn kelly said that he would probably not fly again with nasa but i dont think i would ever say im absolutely finished he said maybe he will fly with private spaceflight companies which are becoming more and more popular they might need a guy like me someday he said maybe in the next years youll be able to buy a cheap ticket just go for a little visitn,ele,WNL NASA Astronaut
himalayan lakes spacewalks and the us presidential campaign helped scott kelly stay sane during his days in space the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on earth from a recordbreaking mission it seemed like i lived there forever kelly said he had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt maybe occasionally you do go bananas he saidn kelly and a russian colleague mikhail kornienko spent nearly a year on the international space station iss in order to study the effects of weightlessness radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans nasa considers this research essential for a future mission to marsn kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips kelly and his twin brother mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests the tests will continue to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ightn he said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan kelly said he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area it was the fresh air mixed with the charred kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived reentry through the atmospheren as he left the spacecraft he said the importance of the mission began to sink in days on a year old space station which is a million pounds the size of a football eld the internal volume some say of a sixbedroom house the iss he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international teamn there are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now kelly said comparing the research of more than missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the s and s he added the view is great toon kelly made the most of that view he posted spectacular photos on social media of the earths cities landscapes oceans and atmosphere the earth is a beautiful planet he said describing the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas he said he would like to visit that region though he would rst need to learn what country actually owns them but mainly you just notice how thin the atmosphere is kelly added that together with these large areas of pollution is kind of alarmingn the astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the us sections of asia with continuous visible pollution nearly all year round he said the message we need to save the planet wasnt completely correct the planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment the worlds thin shield of atmosphere makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down he saidn its for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it if we make the decision to kelly was very active on social media which made many people follow him online but he said he was unaware of it instead he watched the drama of the us presidential electionn besides the news he said steady work helped keep him sane i tried to have milestones that were close like when is the next crew arriving the next spacewalk the next science experiment that made a difference to me it kept my sanity being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in he added he recalled how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission ill soon start feeling that kind of culture shock he saidn kelly predicted that he would not y again with nasa but i dont think i would ever say im absolutely nished he added because of the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as spacex they might need a guy like me someday he said maybe in the next years youll be able to buy a cheap ticket just go for a little visitn n,in,WNL NASA Astronaut
scientists have created an atlas of the brain that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white mattern our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain in this case semantics or the meanings of words said jack gallant a neuroscientist at the university of california berkeleyn no single brain region holds one word or concept a single brain spot is associated with a number of related words and each single word lights up many different brain spots together they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use life and love death and taxes clouds florida and bra all light up their own networksn described as a tour de force by one researcher who was not involved in the study the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks with further advances the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other fieldsn it is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing reading or possibly even thinking said alexander huth the first author on the study one potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or lockedin syndrome to speak through a computern to create the atlas the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories read out on the moth radio hour a us radio show they then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in to peasized spots all over the cerebral cortexn huth used stories from the moth radio hour because they are short and compelling the more enthralling the stories the more confident the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off seven people listened to two hours of stories each per person that amounted to hearing roughly words and more than different words as they lay in the scanner the atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain for example on the lefthand side of the brain above the ear is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim the same region responds to killed convicted murdered and confessed on the brains righthand side near the top of the head is one of the brain spots activated by family terms wife husband children parentsn each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings one part of the brain for example reliably responds to the word top along with other words that describe clothing but the word top activates many other regions one of them responds to numbers and measurements another to buildings and places the scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlasn strikingly the brain atlases were similar for all the participants suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way the scientists only scanned five men and two women however all are native english speakers and two are authors of the study published in nature it is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlasesn armed with the atlas researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts from numbers to murder and religion the idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain gallant said using the same data the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language from phonemes to syntax a brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive however every time we come up with a set of narrative features we get told they arent the right set of narrative features said gallantn uri hasson a neuroscientist at princeton university praised the work unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real world scenario he said the next step he added was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas ultimately hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity the ethical implications are enormous one more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public there are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface he said lorraine tyler a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the centre for speech language and the brain at cambridge university said the research was a tour de force in its scope and methods but the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings while this research is pathbreaking in its scope there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain n,adv,WNL Neuroscientists

you can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital new orleans louisiana city after city has banned indoor smoking but thats different because other cities dont attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a let the good times roll attitude as new orleans does an indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as new orleanss cultural ecosystem itself as the wall street journal recently reported new orleans city government has since hurricane katrina in begun trying to turn down the volume a bit with the support of neighbourhood groups the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly while at the same time fighting to implement a new noise ordinance read music ordinance this is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this complains bar owner william walker who for reasons of personal choice hates the antismoking law forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there many of new orleanss best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods this neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes new orleans different and charming recently though this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of new orleanss musical personality feels at stake martha wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music the bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so i wont ever complain about the noise says wood who also manages a livemusic bar which following a series of noise issues in including complaints about the loud smokers outside became one of new orleanss first ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go now any small infraction could get us shut down says wood we recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we cant open the doors at night because of the noise the maple leaf club went smokefree voluntarily in as did another club where artists had been demanding smokefree nights a lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so i wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music says zalia beville manager of the all ways lounge which went smokefree in because she says the horn players and the singers they asked us for it luckily all ways has an outdoor patio unlike lost love lounge whose owner geoff douville loves the ban hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar financially viable theres no way i could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city says douville people act like i have that choice as a business owner but if i make that rule they walk down the block to a bar with smoking so i need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody many small business owners also fear smoke free revenue loss smoker neil timms owns an english pub and met the smoking ban before in england back home in coventry every pub where i was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban remembers timms of the uks ban begun in to avoid the same fate hes spending money to build a patio lost loves douville though feels the ban to be a great business opportunity the number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar with our food but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people nor does douville worry about noise complaints like walker does no court is gonna label a bar a nuisance after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to go outside he says i want to see a judge reconcile no loitering with no smoking inside councilwoman latoya cantrell who introduced and pushed the ban disagrees the responsibility is on the barowner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well she says the owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities the idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous it can be a winwin i think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses cantrell does acknowledge the citys uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban how is new orleans different from the rest of the country new orleans is known as the city that care forgot she says new orleans needs to stand up and say we care about our people the most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry which drives the economy in the state of louisiana she adds new orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke many worried that the already strained new orleans police department didnt need any part in policing smokers so the health department will handle bar warnings and fines bar customers are encouraged to come fill out a form or call and to include dateandtimestamped photographs documenting illegal smoking for this reason alone neil timms says hell comply with the ban i dont want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of em and gets beaten up unworried geoff douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban watch the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with in the end douville shares cantrells winwin optimism of course theyre gonna complain he accepts but it doesnt mean theyre gonna winn,adv,WNL New Orleans

marks a good day even for a seasoned tracker but it is getting easier there are now an estimated wolves in poland the number has doubled in years wolves are along with the brown bear the lynx and the wolverine europes last large predator carnivores conservationists from britain germany and the netherlands are beating a path here to find out how the country has saved this protected species slandered even in fairy tales bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces it ate a red deer says the university of warsaw biologist in my lab i can tell you all about this wolf not only its diet but its gender sexual habits age state of health and family connections dna tests have established that polish wolves are travellers one wolf reached the netherlands where unfortunately it was hit by a car they have a tremendous range they need space the average territory required by a polish pack is sq km said mysajek is there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to scotland asks student alex entwisle on a field trip to southern poland from his college in the uk the animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruceclad beskidy mountains of the polish carpathians their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the british isles for the first time since the th century as the guest of a british charity the wolves and humans foundation mysajek toured the scottish highlands in and took questions from villagers about the polish experience the big difference between scotland and poland is that we eat pork we do not have many sheep here the similarity is that we have a lot of animals red deer and more than roe deer in poland we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar about and these are ravaging farmers cereal crops here wolves are part of the solution he says the scientist who is a familiar face on polish television says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to km during a single hunt the beskidy pack is a strong unit eight or nine individuals this year we have recorded five cubs two yearlings and two adults we track them using motionactivated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow in each family group only one pair reproduces once a year all pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion mys ajek the son of a shepherd is puzzled by wolves bad reputation why does one speak of a lonewolf gunman why did we have to have little red riding hood he is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs wolves are not pooches mysajek says only scientific arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save europes wild carnivores especially the unpopular wolf natural predators balance the ecosystem they keep herbivores in check thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in shoot the deer it is only a partial solution he says in a diverse environment you have the socalled landscape of fear where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass they move away as a precaution to avoid being trapped by a predator this gives the vegetation a chance the ban on wolf hunting in the western carpathians came into force in and nationwide in poland in there are now resident packs in virtually all the countrys major forests the predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off as they are in african safari parks the polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves mysajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences he has helped revive the use of two deterrents that for reasons no one quite understands wolves find particularly scary red bunting hung around sheep pens and the bark of the fluffy white tatra mountain sheepdog the survival and mobility of polands wolves has been helped by the countrys belated infrastructure development in when the communists relinquished power poland had only one motorway major road projects requiring wildlife impact studies began after poland joined the european union in the country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals attitudes have also changed for many years hunting was cultural in there were fewer than wolves in poland beginning in the s hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities they paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a months salary it was carnage mysajek says the improvement in polish wolves survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring russia lithuania belarus ukraine and slovakia he claims polands new government elected in october is hostile to wolves the environment minister jan szyszko makes no secret of being a hunter there are licensed hunters in poland and they are influential in parliament the hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are of them in poland which is a spurious figure based on an unscientific count this government is capable of turning back the clock being a wolf advocate is not easy it is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans they have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell the british animal science students leave the polish carpathians without a wolf sighting just photographs of paw prints and droppings entwisle is convinced that scotland will never be able to match polands success it would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer but it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep there would be problems with farmers we had our industrial revolution too long ago we ruined it for ourselves in britain

organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same benefits as adding one or two portions of the recommended five a day the team led by professor carlo leifert at newcastle university concludes that there are statistically significant meaningful differences with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher between and in

antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition if information linking these compounds to the health benefits associated with increased fruit vegetable and wholegrain consumption is confirmed the findings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people with one expert saying that the findings were exaggerated tom sanders a professor of nutrition at kings college london said the research did show some differences but the question is are they within natural variation and are they nutritionally relevant i am not convinced he said leiferts work had caused controversy in the past leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops the results of the research are based on an analysis of peerreviewed studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit vegetables and cereals the crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat said helen browning chief executive of the soil association which campaigns for organic farming plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight back against pest attacks so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays but the scientists say other reasons may be important such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with artificial fertilizers leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers but they also note that no longterm studies showing health benefits from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted the researchers found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in conventional crops pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food the research was funded by the eu and an organic farming charity the research is certain to be criticized the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poorquality work skews the results although the team did sensitivity analyses and found that excluding weaker work did not significantly change the outcome also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits but the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this and that pesticide limits are set individually not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops a further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates soil types and crop varieties and not from organic farming though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences the greatest criticism however will be over the suggestions of potential health benefits the most recent major analysis which took in studies in found little evidence the published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods it found this was also the conclusion of earlier smaller studies published in in a scientific journal and by the uk food standards agency though the latter considered just studies the study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work you are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food he said what is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or conventional its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all people are buying into a lifestyle system they get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business opinion polls show healthy eating and avoiding chemical residues are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce but many also say care for the environment and animal welfare are important as is taste browning said this research backs up what people think about organic food in other countries there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming we hope these findings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe

according to a recent scientific study organic food has more healthy antioxidants than regular food it also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides the international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended five a day fruit and vegetablesn the team led by professor carlo leifert concludes that there are big differences between organic and nonorganic food organic food has between and more antioxidants it is the first study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits vegetables and cerealsn the researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every day they say this means that organic food is better for our healthn the findings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people tom sanders a professor of nutrition at kings college london said the research showed some differences but are the differences relevant i am not sure he also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular cropsn the results of the research are based on an analysis of studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and regular fruit vegetables and cereals helen browning who supports organic farming said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eatn leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases including diseases of the heart and certain cancers the researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in regular cropsn they found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic foodn people will criticize the research including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits but the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this they also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular cropsn another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates different types of soil and different types of crops they may not be the result of organic farming but the biggest criticism will be about possible health benefits the most recent major analysis which included studies in found little evidence of health benefits other studies did not find evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods it foundn sanders agrees you are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food he said what is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or regular its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at alln shoppers say that healthy eating and avoiding chemicals are the main reasons they buy organic food browning said this research supports what people think about organic food in other countries there is much more support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming we hope that now the uk will accept organic food like people in the rest of europen,ele,WNL Organic Food

to a master traditional navigator like tua pittman from raratonga in the cook islands a canoe is much more than just a means of transport the canoe is our island the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader pittman says he continues explaining that the converse is also true an island is our canoe the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators on a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life it has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the flotilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in sydney for the start of the world parks congress tuas journey began at the cook islands on september the first leg took the islanders to samoa then fiji vanuatu and onto the gold coast before heading south to sydney around crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques unfortunately said tua the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach australia in time for the congress the official title of the expedition is the mua voyage and it is a partnership between the international union for conservation of nature iucn oceania regional office and five pacific island countries samoa tonga new zealand the cook islands and fiji the main goal of the nauticalmile km trip was to deliver a special message to the world parks congress in part the message said we see the signs of overexploitation we no longer see the fish and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past we witness the change as foreign fishing fleets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing our ocean is vast but not limitless growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life in spite of the effort and urgency behind the pacific islanders message to the delegates of the congress much of the final days of the marine part of the congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries according to the iucn as of the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take this was despite a target of notake areas set by the last world parks congress held in south africa in worldleading marine scientist professor callum roberts from the university of york was one of the scientists who helped set the target in but he said it was not enough the iucn should now lift its target from to new research strengthens the case for the target set previously to now be raised any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans after difficult negotiations the world parks congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management instead of the aspirational target the iucns new official position is to urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and wellconnected systems of mpas marine protected areas or other effective conservation measures by these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services tua pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the congress its just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard to hear they made that resolution is fantastic its a step in the right direction he says that while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun moon and stars that never changed and would at least on a human scale always be there other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the pacific he said he was and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch fish on the open ocean he also said that pollution was worsening particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as sydney and the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on pacific islanders the decisions of the big countries have twice thrice four times the impact on the small countries than on developed large nations many times people dont even know where our islands are and from the eyes of a traditional navigator our people have a very very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes the mua voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said tua years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted the leaders of wealthy countries he went on need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea most importantly and spoken like a true navigator tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations the world needs to find a different path n,adv,WNL Pacific Islanders

temperature rises resulting from unchecked climate change will be at the severe end of those projected according to a new scientic study the scientist leading the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases were cut the planet would heat up by a minimum of c by twice the level the worlds governments deem dangerous the research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms meaning less sunlight is reected back into space driving temperatures up further still the way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change professor steven sherwood at the university of new south wales in australia who led the new work said this study breaks new ground twice rst by identifying what is controlling the cloud changes and second by strongly discounting the lowest estimates of future global warming in favour of the higher and more damaging estimates c would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous sherwood said for example it would make life difcult if not impossible in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the greenland ice sheet and some of the antarctic ice sheet with sea levels rising by many metres as a result the research is a big advance that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions according to scientists commenting on the study published in the journal nature hideo shiogama and tomoo ogura at japans national institute for environmental studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected but they said more challenges lay ahead to narrow down further the projections of future temperatures scientists measure the sensitivity of the earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of co in the atmosphere compared with preindustrial levels as is likely to happen within years on current trends for two decades those estimates have run from c to c a wide range the new research narrowed that range to between c and c by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds the key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures when water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds in reality both processes occur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted signicantly higher future temperatures than those only including the ninemilehigh clouds climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the rst to admit they are not perfect said sherwood but what we are nding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming not those that predict more he added sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the th century but there is increasing evidence that this inaptly named hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary global average air temperatures have increased relatively slowly since a high point in caused by the ocean phenomenon el nio but observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases with over disappearing into the oceans furthermore a study in november suggested the pause may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions where warming is greatest sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot denitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections but he said for that to be the case one would need to invoke some new dimension to the problem involving a major missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence such a thing is not out of the question but requires a lot of faith he added rises in global average temperatures of at least c by will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we dont urgently start to curb our emissions n,adv,WNL Planet

up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by unless countries focus on inequalities and confront social economic and cultural forces that block their escape or pull them back into impoverishment a major report warns the report by the chronic poverty advisory network cpan asserts that many people may rise above the poverty line of a day only to tumble back when they are hit by a combination or sequence of shocks such as drought illness and insecurity or conflict drawing on household panel surveys the report found that in parts of rural kenya and in south africa to of those who escaped from poverty fell back rising to in some areas of ethiopia between and even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam the proportion has been individual cases highlight the ease with which people can slip back into poverty amin from rural bangladesh has seen his livelihood gradually decline due to his own and his wifes illnesses the cost of his sons marriage the death of his father and loss of goods such as fishing nets lovemore from zimbabwe has become one of the poorest people in his village he recently lost his job as a carpark attendant due to ill health and had to take in his five grandchildren after the death of his daughters we need to ensure that people lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently too many families are experiencing two steps forward one step back where they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks governments shouldnt assume that just because somebodys income hits that means job done said andrew shepherd research fellow at the overseas development institute a partner of cpan and lead author of the report a un highlevel panel considering a new development framework to succeed the millennium development goals after said the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by was within reach the report however argues that more of the same will not get to zero despite a drop in extreme poverty from bn in to bn in the report says that progress in the next years will be much harder the big gains in china are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere while climaterelated shocks and deep poverty in parts of subsaharan africa will slow momentum the report calls for a shift in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronically poor those who are poor for many years or their entire lives and for more emphasis on stopping impoverishment the descent into poverty governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy there is a tendency to pick the lowhanging fruit but they have shied away from the more difficult job of tackling chronic poverty said shepherd the report says progress on poverty reduction while impressive to date has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line it will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies prioritize those living in chronic poverty it adds policymakers must aim for a zero tripod of separate but interdependent objectives tackle chronic poverty stop impoverishment sustain poverty escapes they put forward a trio of policies all of which require massive global investment the first is social assistance a safety net to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living an example of such a scheme is ethiopias productive safety net programme that allowed thousands of vulnerable households to withstand drought without having to curtail education spending the second is education from early childhood to the start of work to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty education also has the advantage of being a portable asset the third is propoorest economic growth policies to ensure that the benefits of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people economic growth really is critical but not just any old growth shepherd said it has to generate not just employment but decent jobs not just insecure lowpaying jobs there are ways of doing this like indias rural employment guarantees scheme which has boosted urban not just rural wages another example cited by the report is south africas extension of the minimum wage to groups such as domestic workers all this will take money and the report says one obvious implication is that stronger domestic tax systems and greater tax revenues will be required aid will also be needed for the startup costs for social assistance universal health coverage and to finance education including scholarships for the poorest children there remains a huge role for aid in the next years as many developing countries spend less than on each of their citizens a year even nigeria with its oil wealth spends only per capita shepherd said against a backdrop of crises in syria south sudan and the central african republic conflict and environmental disasters have to be addressed and the report says it is essential that governments work to reduce the risk of conflict and to establish inclusive peace settlements choose the best answer according to the text who are the chronically poor incorporating reducing income inequality as a post goal would steer the international agenda in the right direction given that lessening or containing inequality speeds up the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction the report argues that if the inequalities that affect the poorest people such as access to land labour markets and the power relationships between men and women are addressed this would tackle two goals at the same time reducing chronic poverty and inequality the authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure the poorest people are represented politically as well as tackling difficult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty this often means challenging and perhaps sweeping away aspects of the status quo and represents the most marked departure from business as usual,adv,WNL Poverty

david cameron has declared a clear result in the scottish independence referendum after scotland voted by a point margin against ending the yearold union with england and wales the prime minister promised a devolution revolution across great britain including votes on english issues by english mps at westminster as he welcomed scotlands decision to remain inside the uk there can be no disputes no reruns we have heard the settled will of the scottish people cameron said in a statement earlier scotlands first minister alex salmond remained defiant at a downbeat scottish national party rally in edinburgh saying he accepted scotland had not at this stage decided to vote for independence he paid tribute to what he called a triumph for democratic politics and said he would work with westminster in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk warning the leaders of the three main parties to make good on their promises of enhanced devolution for scotland we have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics he said the yes campaign scored four big successes winning of the vote in scotlands largest city glasgow in dundee and in north lanarkshire however the no camp was victorious in authorities it won overwhelmingly in areas where it was expected to do well including edinburgh aberdeenshire and borders but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign including the western isles in the final count the no camp won votes to for yes in his speech cameron made clear that the constitutional reforms including in scotland would not be delivered until after the general election and that scottish measures would proceed in tandem with changes in england we have heard the voice of scotland and now the millions of voices of england must be heard he said cameron added the people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result they have kept our country of four nations together and like millions of other people i am delighted as i said during the campaign it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end and i know that sentiment was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future so now it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement fair to people in scotland and importantly to everyone in england wales and northern ireland as well ed miliband the labour leader said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change we know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for we will deliver on stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament a strong scotland but he said that would go beyond scotland we will also meet the desire for change across england across wales across the whole of the united kingdom nick clegg the deputy prime minister said the referendum marks not only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the union echoing the snps argument he said a vote against independence was clearly not a vote against change we must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland he added yet that result raises the risk of further turmoil with mps from camerons conservative party threatening to revolt against the prime ministers late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the scottish parliaments powers while protecting its spending the uk independence party leader nigel farage said camerons offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough the english are by population of this union theyve been left out of all of this for the last years we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on englishonly issues i think what most english people want is a fair settlement he said cameron and the queen will both move to calm tensions when they deliver statements on the result the prime minister will try in the words of one cabinet minister to cement in the no vote by outlining how he will deliver the deepening of scotlands devolution settlement including handing greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh the queen who has monitored the referendum with interest will make a written statement it is understood that her remarks will focus on reconciliation the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will live up to their commitments made during the referendum campaign to deliver what the former prime minister gordon brown called home rule within the uk ministers believe it is important to move quickly to avoid a repeat of the referendum in qubec the triumphalist behaviour of ontario fuelled the separatist cause that nearly succeeded in a second referendum in for the no campaign there was relief a spate of authoritative polls in the final days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knifeedge bringing yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a

the world shares him and london claims him but stratforduponavon intends to spend celebrating william shakespeare as their man the bard of avon born in the warwickshire market town in who died there years ago stratford remained hugely important throughout shakespeares life argues paul edmondson the head of learning and research at the shakespeare birthplace trust people have seen shakespeare as someone who turns his back on stratford and his family goes to london to earn his fortune and only comes back to die he said but stratford is where he bought land and property where he kept his library where he lived and read and thought we are going to spend the year reemphasizing the importance of shakespeare the man of stratford the seveneenthcentury diarist antiquarian and gossip john aubrey born years after shakespeare died was at pains to point out there was nothing so very special about the bard aubrey university educated unlike shakespeare said that he acted exceedingly well and that his playes took well the world has not agreed with aubrey the anniversary of the death of the man from stratford the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across britain and the globe macbeth will open in singapore romeo and juliet in brussels shakespeares globe is completing the first world tour in the history of theatre in which it has taken hamlet to

brightonbased spymonkeys complete deaths a romp through the deaths including a fly squashed in titus andronicus by stabbing poisoning smothering and smashing across the plays there will also be hundreds of lectures recitals international academic conferences films concerts operas and major exhibitions for a man famous in his own lifetime there is little documentary evidence for shakespeares life and times the plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could find drafts prompt scripts scribbled actors parts and plays not known in any other version into the precious first folio published in seven years after shakespeares death the actor mark rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving first folios will be on display including those belonging to the british and bodleian libraries and a tattered copy recently discovered in france some of the most precious surviving documents will be gathered together in an exhibition at somerset house in london jointly organized by the national archives and kings college london including four of his six known signatures which are all slightly different the exhibition by me william shakespeare will include his will the court papers relating to the audacious move when shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the thames and rebuilt it as the globe on the south bank and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for boxing day performances for james i and queen anne the outgoing globe director dominic dromgoole recently jokily claimed shakespeare as a true londoner albeit conceding some spurious claim by stratforduponavon stratford however will be insisting that the town made and educated shakespeare his old school room is being restored with a m heritage lottery grant and will open as a permanent visitor attraction shakespeare bought the splendid new place the second best house in the town where he died according to literary legend on st georges day april the same day as his birth you dont buy a house like new place and not live there paul edmondson said the general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of stratford to shakespeare edmondson believes that after shakespeare bought the house in all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays including the tempest were at least planned in his library and probably written there the shakespeare birthplace trust describes new place as the jewel in the crown of the th anniversary celebrations but in truth it is more of a gaping hole where the gem should be shakespeares house was demolished years ago and the house that replaced it probably incorporating some of the original fabric was flattened in by an irascible clergyman francis gastrell in a row over taxes he had already cut down shakespeares mulberry tree under which the writer is said to have sat and worked because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden the gap in the stratford streetscape has never been filled but a fiveyear archaeology project has peeled back the years and the news that shakespeares kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world the whole site is being redisplayed for the anniversary with the foundations marked and the

there are eyes on you behind the bright lights and mirrored panels pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you dont slip it into your bag enter a department store and you will be watched but new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age sex size head shoulders knees and toes a few months ago it firm computer sciences corporation csc produced a report that claimed around of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers instore facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database using devices such as intel realsense cameras which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing joe jensen of intels retail solutions division says that the aim of bringing realsense technology into shops is not to create databases of specific peoples lives but rather to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits its not so much that you need to know a particular customer its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and in the past that when those characteristics are present this is what a person tends to do if you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop if say theres a size woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle you can use that data to predict she wants to well buy socks that could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed specifically at that person if she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks they will show her adverts for socks if it sounds familiar its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years if you search for something on amazon youll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites express a vague interest in canoeing and youll get ads for canoes wherever you go yet bringing these systems into the physical world isnt a simple case of copy and paste it turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies hoxton analytics a londonbased team of data scientists has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing by analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor the system can identify a customers gender with between and accuracy owen mccormack hoxton analytics ceo says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition my idea was why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing to understand demographics he said if i just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are however it turns out pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition the idea was what about peoples shoes the word creepy comes up a lot during discussions of instore tracking for retailers and data scientists the aim is to find a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive for hoxton analytics and the retailers using the technology the answer is to look downwards this tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we as physical beings react to being watched it suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded but is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any less invasive for mccormack the argument hinges on the fact that personally identifiable information isnt being collected right now shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just dont know about it the angle hoxton analytics is taking on that whole thing is well if you know someones a male or a female then your advertising will be much more efficient if you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male youll be advertising playstations not hairdryers keep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix however and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you the argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area it still feels creepy from the perspective of retailers its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect we allow this to happen online so why not offline the thresholds of a shopping centre are different from those between websites and when you can wander freely from one place to another without a popup asking you to accept cookies the rules of consent change then again for a generation growing up with online first physical shop second the modes of online play may not be quite so invasive in the csc report a survey indicated that while of respondents aged and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops only of year olds said the same does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying instinctive certainty or does it ebb and flow with degrees of social acceptance whatever the case there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearingn,adv,WNL Shops

the view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of doana national park in southern spain is striking to say the least this is an ornithologists dream hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western europe dozens of britains most loved migratory birds including house martins swallows cuckoos and warblers rest here on their annual migrations from africa doana a un world heritage site is also home to some of europes rarest birds including the spanish imperial eagle while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered iberian lynx it is a glorious vibrant landscape yet it exists on a knifeedge a point illustrated dramatically in when almost two billion gallons of contaminated highly acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at los frailes mine km to the north a toxic tsunami of waste poured down the guadiamar river and over its banks leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland more than kilos of dead fish were collected in the aftermath and nearly adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed it was spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost m suddenly aware of doanas status as the nations most important natural site spain decided to spend a further m some of it eu money on restoring the landscape which in the s and s had been drained in places to create rice and cotton fields some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state it has been a costly but encouraging process yet the fate of doana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through doana while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that crisscross doana however the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the andalucan government to reopen the frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed doana in this is europes most precious bird sanctuary both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between africa and britain and other parts of northwest europe says laurence rose of the rspb royal society for the protection of birds doana already faces a great number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of its nearundoing years ago it is extremely worrying having spent so much restoring doana to its past glories it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework los frailes however a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation the crash of spains banks in hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of andaluca is now more than reopening the mine would provide more than precious jobs there are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said vicente fernndez guerrero secretarygeneral of innovation industry and energy for andaluca we think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area this is a mining area people have been digging metals and ores here since roman times after all more to the point added fernndez the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste would be allowed it has also stipulated that the canadian company that ran los frailes cannot bid for the contract sixteen years after the accident the two sides remained locked over compensation claims the best technology in the world will be used here fernndez insisted liquid will not be used we are going to insist on that our tender makes that clear the proposal has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition one road sign i passed was liberally daubed with obscenities about the workers union ugt which supports the mines reopening for his part carlos dvila who works for the spanish ornithological society in doana was also alarmed at the proposal this is a very very bad idea indeed he told me they say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in and look what happened we got the worst ecological disaster in the history of spain what alarms people such as dvila is the threat that a new mine poses to the intense investment in ecotourism that has been made in doana in recent years an example is provided at the restaurant dehesa de abajo where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites are nesting virtually every visitor was equipped with a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars there is a clear tourist trade to be made from the birdlife of doana nor should this be surprising for this is a truly special place a vast hemisphere of sky hangs over this utterly flat but certainly not featureless landscape birds of every shape and size fill the air and sometimes the road at one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to fly off the trouble is that spain does not have the public resources it possessed years ago a repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much much more damaging impact said rose this point is backed by dvila after the disaster spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and

a long time ago cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far far away one where imperial cruisers battled rebel fighters where droids rubbed circuits with wookiees and where a spaceship called the millennium falcon could make the kessel run in less than parsecs that was but in as the franchise approaches its seventh bigscreen instalment interest in star wars shows no sign of abating now there is news of a new film about han solo and of a reappearance for darth vader countless fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art new trailers and other information said paul dergarabedian senior media analyst at boxoffice monitor rentrak its hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could evoke such a level of passion enthusiasm and excitement the latest star wars mania dates from the hollywood studio disneys purchase of lucasfilm from the films creator george lucas in the bn acquisition was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential episodes vii viii and ix plus then unspecified plans for spinoff movies and standalones to fill the gaps in the release schedule details of the second spinoff have now been made public an origins story about han solo the intergalactic smuggler played by harrison ford in the first three films which is scheduled to be released in may it will follow the release in december of episode vii directed by jj abrams and titled star wars the force awakens the unnamed episode viii due out in and the already announced spinoff rogue one which will arrive in cinemas in that movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the death star a key plot element of the first film in levels of interest in the rumour that rogue one will also feature the reappearance of darth vader the blackclad villain of the original series only confirmed the power of star wars nostalgia in creating a multistranded multicharacter cinema universe around star wars lucasfilmdisney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of films produced by marvel studios which disney also acquired in disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing star wars films available on streaming services as a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new film and reinvigorate the idea of star wars in the minds of the fans whether it needs reinvigorating is questionable the level of enthusiasm that has surrounded star wars for at least the last two decades is evidenced by what has become known as the expanded universe the plethora of novels comic books video games and merchandising that lucasfilm has created or licensed over the years this extra material began emerging as far back as but was given a massive kick by the mushrooming of the internet in the s roleplay and fan participation show no sign of slowing in the uk eventcinema brand secret cinema have found considerable commercial success with their live staging of the empire strikes back michael rosser news editor for screen international suggests that it is this shared universe of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps star wars in pole position among film franchises the great thing about the original films was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers he said for years people have been wondering how the different strands would play out this new film because its going back to han solo and luke skywalker looks as though it will reconnect with the original star wars in a way that the prequels failed to rosser is referring to the three films lucas directed between and the phantom menace attack of the clones and revenge of the sith which chronicled the life of luke skywalkers father anakin who transforms into darth vader despite being greeted with lessthanstellar reviews the prequels took bn at the worldwide box office shortly after the release of restored and augmented special editions of the first trilogy had netted m in it shows the power of star wars that although they were disappointing the prequels still managed to make a lot of money said rosser in a film business where branding is all and a successful franchise the answer to everybodys prayers is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema for its own sake rosser thinks not they are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and make sure the quality is kept up they are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment but you dont want to watch star wars on your iphone so i dont think its going to run out of steam any time soon meanwhile dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when the force awakens reaches cinemas in december we are certainly looking at a record opening for december and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide truly star wars is the ultimate movie brandn,adv,WNL Star Wars

we may not yet be living in an age of flying cars as predicted in the film back to the future ii but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as farfetched experts agree that economic and demographic changes technological advances and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape its a very dynamic time said robert puentes of the brookings institutions metropolitan policy program think tank theres a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people as the average us commute lengthens and the countrys infrastructure ages badly cities across the us are being forced to redefine what transportation is increasingly urban planners transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old autocentric models focused on easing traffic congestion arent enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions and transportation is now more than ever an integral component of a citys larger sustainability efforts big us cities like los angeles seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment essentially making transportation intelligent the most sustainable places to live are those places that have multimodal transport systems puentes said you cant be a global competitive city if you dont have a robust transportation network here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years the rise of ridesharing services like uber and lyft essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button and apps like waze which uses realtime traffic data to find the quickest routes for drivers are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traffic moves through a city communication between riders and drivers between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era according to allan clelland an expert on transportation technology according to a recent study from the uclas institute of transportation studies vehicle travel has declined among millennials individuals born roughly between the early s and early s compared to previous generations according to the study those born in the s are making fewer car trips and travelling fewer miles per year on average than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives meanwhile those still driving cars are dealing with less traffic thanks to waze experts say the traffic app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods this has angered residents who claim the increased traffic on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life this trend could continue as vehicletovehicle data communication as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure grows currently a traffic light can detect when a car is approaching but thats about it companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in but noone really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace however the partial automation of cars is already underway alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages first there might be automated buses with their own lanes then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns essentially vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single file the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the efficiency of car owners who can get on with other tasks during a long commute it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion and allow more people access to cars but even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is years old to see what driverless cars might look like in action go to the video at vimeocom as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation spurring everything from zero and lowemission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking biking and carpooling sharon feigon executive director of the shared use mobility center envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day if their train is delayed for instance they can access a city bike take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass were going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them she said when considering the future of transportation its also important to keep in mind why people travel they may be going to work to meet friends or family or to do the shopping technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips say virtual meetings or telecommuting could also have a big impact on transportation there was a time when the idea of a flying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decadesn,adv,WNL Still no flying cars

from glowinthedark trees to underground bike sheds and solarpowered bins we look at some of the more leftfield solutions to help make our cities more livable city living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them pollution traffic and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that citydwellers have to deal with step forward the inventors we consider ten of the wackier solutions to making our cities more livable popup parksn todays cities sometimes look like theyre built more for cars than people the popup park is a simple idea take an empty car park a pocketful of change and a pot plant or two and make yourself your own private park the parking project kicked off as an arts experiment in san francisco and has since spread across the world temporary urban farms and ecology demos are just some of the ideas to have emerged out of the movement which celebrates a day of action every septembern subterranean storagen not all urban dwellers are hooked to the car bikes are ever more in vogue the question is where to keep it safe tokyobased engineering firm giken has come up with a concept for a solution an ecocycle antiseismic underground bicycle park at just seven metres wide the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house bikes owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button with the automated system delivering it back above ground in around secondsn glowinthedark treesn when most people think of trees that glow in the dark christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind not daan roosegaarde the dutch designerartist has comes up with a bioluminescent plant the experimental technology splices dna from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a jellyfishtype glow trials are underway to create an industrialscale version of the biomimicryinspired technology that roosegaarde hopes could one day replace conventional street lightingn footfall harvestingn every day hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east london neighbourhood of west ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station few probably notice the springiness beneath their feet fewer still connect that fivemillimetre flex in the rubber surface to the powering of the streetlights above the paved flooring is decked with smart tiles that capture the kinetic energy from pedestrians footsteps and convert it into electricity pavegen the uk firm behind the innovation has installed a similar system at londons heathrow airport among other international locationsn supertreesn it had to happen eventually manmade trees singapores gardens by the bay has a small copse of them up to metres high these steelframed supertrees not only have flowers and ferns growing up them but their metallic canopies act to absorb and disperse heat too theyre equipped to harvest rainwater too as well as provide air ventilation for two climatecontrolled biomes large conservatories in other words below eleven of the trees also boast solar panels along their branchesn waterproducing billboardn we live in a consumer world and so we dont forget it advertisers wallpaper our cities and highways with banks of billboards researchers at limas university of engineering and technology have come up with a billboard with a difference using a system of condensers and filters it traps the humidity in the air and extracts the water vapour to produce around litres of drinking water a day the public can help themselves to it for freen neowalled gardensn gardens stopped being just the preserve of peoples front lawns long ago for a while roof gardens were all the rage now its all about walls drawing on advances in hydroponics growing plants without soil the facades of a growing number of libraries and offices shops and hotels are bursting into flower one of the companies at the forefront of the living wall boom is ukbased firm biotecture the companys vertical gardens can be seen gracing the taj hotel in central london and the exit wall of edgware road tube station among other locations aesthetics aside green walls are credited with reducing air pollution and improving air qualityn algaepowered buildingn to prove the dynamism of the living wall concept look no further than hamburgs international building exhibition instead of sweetsmelling flowers the southfacing facades of the zerocarbon apartment complex are laced with greentinged algae the walls external fabric includes a bioskin of hollow grass panels on which the algae photosynthesizes and grows periodically the algae is harvested from the walls and fermented in a biogas plant to produce electricityn smart rubbish binsn forget gasguzzling dumper trucks and smelly skips city authorities around the world are now turning to solarpowered trash compactors to keep litter off the streets the galloncapacity rubbish bins are equipped with a motor that pushes down the rubbish when it nears the top the motor is powered by solar panels embedded in the lid the newest bigbelly bins include a wireless monitoring system that notifies rubbish collectors when the bins are fulln spray paintn finally desperate times may sometimes call for desperate measures thats clearly what was going through the minds of authorities in chengdu one of chinas fastest growing cities to brighten up the place the municipal landscaping department has taken to spraying the yellowing grass green use of the nontoxic green spray has now spread to tianjin and a host of

agios efstratios is so remote so forgotten by the banks the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network cant process data and there isnt a single atm or creditcard machine on the island before greece was plunged into financial chaos residents of this tranquil outpost in the northern aegean managed quite well they did their banking at the post office and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked out every summer with people who had heard by word of mouth of its spectacular empty beaches clear seas and fresh seafood but because the island still runs on cash the closure of banks nationwide has been devastating residents have been forced to make ninehour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and greek visitors say they cant get together enough money to come tourist numbers are down this year said mayor maria kakali in an office in the village where she grew up home to around people even people born here and living in athens who have their own places on the island arent coming kakali has badgered the government and a major greek bank into promising an atm within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income fishing and agriculture we have almost no reservations in august when usually we have people calling us up asking to find a room and we cant help them a hard winter ahead may be slightly improved by workers billeted in the village to expand the harbour but there is an even bigger crisis looming because the government has said it will end a decadesold tax break for islands created to help island communities survive when they were suffering mass emigration a lower sales tax contained the costs of living in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable tourist favourites such as mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with turkey but for agios efstratios it poses a far greater threat if we have to pay a tax of im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island says kakali food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland there are no economies of scale and little economic flexibility on an island which even in summer has only three shops two restaurants and not a single official hotel this is an expensive island everything even milk or bread has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a profit said provatas costas a yearold fisherman for agios efstratios and its closest large neighbour lemnos the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel they were condemned to relative obscurity for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries in the government had finally given the contract to a new efficient company drawing floods of new visitors to explore the islands largely overlooked charms before the bank controls hit it started out as the best season in years and in one week became the worst said atzamis konstantinos a travel agent in lemnos who used to earn a month as a captain of petroleum tankers and other large ships but came home because he missed it so much i always loved this island even when i was young i would dock in piraeus the port in athens take my pay then get the first boat over people would say youre crazy you can go anywhere but i only ever wanted to come here lemnos has dozens of wild beaches where even at the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone a small nightlife scene and numerous cultural sites it is the eighth largest island in greece so is in line for the first round of tax increases in autumn but far less wealthy than many smaller ones it has just over beds for visitors compared with tens of thousands on an island such as rhodes its councillors say that they will fight the tax rise although none can say how we have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more said lemnos mayor dimitris marinakis when there is not enough money you reduce your consumption and therefore the whole economy declines the crisis has been particularly hard on people under who often do two or three jobs to make ends meet and still feel they cant afford a family young people fear they are losing their contemporaries in an exodus to match the one that scattered their grandparents friends to america australia and canada what is the future for our generation said katerina fikari who feels she is extremely lucky to work for the local government in lemnos if you work only to pay your bills how can you have dreams for your future if taxes go up even more young people will leave warns mayor kakali who has devoted her year in office to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families because it is one of the smallest islands agios efstratios has until before the rise is due to come in so kakali hopes that the roller coaster of greek politics means it yet may be spared if not though she plans to travel to athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost the truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north aegean she said so i would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament to tell them there is still life in these islandsn,adv,WNL The Greek island

that millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret more than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed almost two thirds admit to texting while driving one in five has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a profile on a social networking site compared to other generations millennials are the most active on social media according to a report with of them having created at least one social media account in contrast only of generation x of baby boomers and of those aged and older use social media but there is a small percentage of millennials who dont use social media at all meet the millennials bucking the trend celan beausoleil oakland california beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off more off than on relationship with facebook she last deactivated her account in december after finding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands a lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life including people that i dont really have a relationship with she said it feels almost like intimacy overload she added im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also but beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on facebook for as long as she did one thing i really liked about facebook was that i could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones facebook page from the other side of the world she said i used to do that all the time one day i realized im spending so much time doing this these little seconds add up i wonder what it would be like if i didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else what if i was doing other things with these seconds what would they become would i enjoy it mathias who works for the baltimore city government had facebook and twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in november but he quickly forgot that facebook existed after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence he can still appreciate the benefits that come with having social media accounts like when he met his girlfriends friends for the first time and realized humanizing people youre meeting at a party is much easier if you can connect their faces hometowns and jobs to a photo later on or how easy it is to organize large events online mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he slips through the cracks but now he relishes the time thats freed up he spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed and with no friends accounts to follow online he has to pick up the phone and call them something hes come to definitely enjoy lauren raskauskas naples florida raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person so social media which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others is not that appealing to her im more privacyminded and have concerns about giving out my data said raskauskas who is currently looking for a job she recently deleted her twitter account and deactivated her facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what i was doing but raskauskas who was late to the facebook game because her parents were really strict with technology can see the positive sides of social media when a friend of hers that shed lost track of moved to naples for a month raskauskas didnt even realize she was there until after shed left which the yearold said was a bummer but in the end her privacy concerns outweighed any benefits social media could provide and she saw a definite upside when she went through a recent breakup the last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online it was not pleasant one time i did break up with somebody while i was on facebook and i was like oh my gosh should i change my profile photo should i change my status and this time i dont have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard she said rajagopalan a student at boston college doesnt see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media he claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point even though classmates post about parties and events on facebook they make sure to send him a text message too he said since i was young i was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me he said in fact the only time rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college before starting his first year at college he signed up for his first and only social media account he joined facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year months later he still has the account but he admits i dont use it i dont check it or anything like that the most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos he has avoided social media accounts in all other situations though he has felt the draw of twitter as a sports fan he acknowledged that its where most of the news breaks out but he refused to get an account stating i dont really need one to read tweetsn,adv,WNL The

although much of his work and arguably nearly all the best of it was firmly within the discipline of the blues bb king was always openminded and interested when he found himself in other settings bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill perhaps it is premature to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine any future blues artist matching kings influence over musicians by the thousand and audiences by the million in a career spanning years riley b king the b did not seem to stand for a name was born near itta bena mississippi and grew up with the limited prospects of an africanamerican agricultural worker a barrier he gradually worked to overcome as he learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and honed his singing with a quartet of gospel singers in his early s he moved to memphis within a couple of years he was playing regularly at a bar in west memphis arkansas he also became a disc jockey presenting a show on a memphis radio station his billing the beale street blues boy was shortened to blues boy king and thence to bb after a single session in for a nashville label king began recording for the west coastbased modern records in he had his first hit in with a dramatic rearrangement of three oclock blues which topped the rb chart for weeks it was the first of a list of successes such as please love me you upset me baby and sweet sixteen on these and his dozens of other recordings most of them his own compositions king developed a style that was both innovative and rooted in blues history he was always ready to praise the musicians who had influenced him and would usually mention tbone walker first ive tried my best to get that sound he told the guitar player magazine i came pretty close but never quite got it in an interview in he said if tbone walker had been a woman i would have asked him to marry me but he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists blind lemon jefferson and lonnie johnson and the jazz players charlie christian and django reinhardt he once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill i started to bend notes because i could never play in the bottleneck style like elmore james and booker white i loved that sound but just couldnt do it he was similarly selfdeprecating about his singing a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon mixed halfandhalf from crooners such as nat king cole and blues shouters such as joe turner and dr clayton probably his favourite composer and singer was louis jordan whose music he commemorated in the album let the good times roll throughout the s king was the leading blues artist on the circuit of blackpatronized theatres and clubs on an interminable series of onenighters in he is supposed to have filled engagements in he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label abc but the first records under that contract which tried to reshape him as a mainstream pop singer were as unsatisfactory to his admirers as they were to abcs accountants the album live at the regal however proved the durability of kings blues repertoire and has become iconic a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians he had further rb hits with blues numbers including how blue can you get and paying the cost to be the boss and in he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts where no blues artist had been for many years with the thrill is gone it took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience for whom the blues was largely defined by the chicago school of muddy waters and howlin wolf but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him about a year and a half ago he said in all of a sudden kids started coming up to me saying youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world and id say who told you that and theyd say mike bloomfield or eric clapton its to these youngsters that i owe my new popularity he acquired further rock credibility with the album indianola mississippi seeds on which he collaborated with carole king and joe walsh from then on king was firmly established as the chairman of the board of blues singers guided by his manager sidney seidenberg he embarked on international concert tours that took him to japan australia china and russia he also gave concerts to prisoners at the cook county jail in chicago and at san quentin experiences that led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes in king was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the us could not catch up with him every year or two though he would now deliver most of his act seated the strength of his singing and the fluency of his playing were only very gradually diminished the celebrations for his th birthday in included an awardwinning album of collaborations with clapton mark knopfler roger daltrey gloria estefan and others tributes from musicians as diverse as bono amadou bagayoko and elton john and a farewell tour that proved not to be a farewell at all in king received a grammy award for best traditional blues album for one kind favor in he performed at a

introduction did you know that in the uk there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff its a fact thats covered in a governmentled review released in may in which workers employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process off the back of it ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure lowpaid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers the government have announced a twomonth consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness among the reviews revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards in some restaurants the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash if they dont collect enough tips to cover these fees the government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions the government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary calling for the system to be made more transparent with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy we asked waiters around the uk what they think of the tipping process including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair and what would improve it for them rodri london around of a waiters income is tips average tips per eighthour shift i think they treat waiters best in the us everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of this is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees however you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains ive heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc a payment arrangement used to distribute tips some restaurants will take of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee so if you sell worth of food the company will take this is regardless of how much you make in tips this means that if a table has a bill and doesnt tip the waiter has to pay of their own money this leads to a moneygrabbing culture and ironically to bad service if a table doesnt tip the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers i can average around in tips per shift but on a good night this goes up to over and on a poor night its around around of a waiters income is tips all restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure america has it pretty good everyone tips elle edinburgh we never know whether its fair average tips per eighthour shift i think they treat waiters best in france i work three jobs all on parttime zerohours contracts in catering and hospitality my main day job is in a caf where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally my main evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra per hour which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff my third job is events catering and nobody ever tips in restaurants because a lot of customers add tips through card payments the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not the system seems better in france where they dont tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job offering job security and a decent income ashley london tips go towards customer breakages average tips per eighthour shift i think they treat waiters best in australia i work in a southeast london pub in the evenings and i do day shifts at a local restaurant in both places tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers if a member of the team gets off early they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes it is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out especially when one member of the team underperforms equally when a member of the team does incredibly well they dont get what theyve earned its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers the managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips i make around a shift but would only be given of that money when i am tipped well the tips hugely impact on my finances occasionally i will earn over in one night which almost doubles my earnings for that day however i never get more than of that money after it has been shared out i really rely on tips because i am only paid an hour id rather we earned a good basic wage like in australia and therefore didnt have to rely on tips to make ends meet tom manchester a big night of tips can help pay the rent average tips per eighthour shift i think they treat waiters best in italy where i used to work floor staff kept of cash tips and of card tips the other of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar the went into a tronc system which helped boost kitchen salaries im not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses its hard to say how much i earned a shift maybe around from card tips it can make a massive change to your weekly finances sometimes people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent they have got tipping right in italy where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so if they get a meal for they leave a note and dont ask for change they respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience showsn,adv,WNL Waiters

reducing food wastage would ease the burden on resources as the world attempts to meet future demand the problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways in developing countries there are high levels of what is known as food loss which is unintentional wastage often due to poor equipment transportation and infrastructure in wealthy countries there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of food waste which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards in developed countries consumers and retailers throw away between and of all food purchased whereas in poorer countries only to of food is thrown away according to a report in europe and north america each person wasted to kg of otherwise edible food annually whereas in subsaharan africa and south and southeast asia the equivalent waste was just to kg in the developing world food waste is virtually nonexistent says robert van otterdijk coordinator of the un food and agriculture organizations save food programme food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food one statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries m tonnes a year is almost the same as the total net food production of subsaharan africa m tonnes but food losses on the other hand are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have from management of production to transportation and distribution the environmental impact of food loss and waste is high the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at gigatonnes of co meaning that if food waste were a country it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the us and china about bn hectares or close to of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted and more surface and groundwater or blue water is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country including india and china the whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the earth can provide says van otterdijk production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and if onethird of all this is just produced in vain you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources on land water energy and greenhouse gas emissions the worst food waste offenders are the us canada australia and new zealand where consumers waste of all food purchased followed by europe where about of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away in the uk m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year british consumers throw away m tonnes of edible food each year this means that of all food purchased is avoidably wasted at an estimated cost to each family of a year or almost a month the foods most commonly found in british bins are bread vegetables fruit and milk according to a nationwide analysis of food waste in uk households the most wasted food in the uk by weight is bread with consumers throwing away tonnes of all bread purchased by percentage the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads of which consumers throw away tonnes of all they buy the most wasted meat by both percentage and weight is poultry of which of all edible parts not including bones is wasted and the most wasted fruit by percentage is melon with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown in the bin the uk has made progress in the past ten years after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage it is singled out by van otterdijk as one of the great successes in combating food waste between and the amount of avoidable food waste produced by uk households decreased by from m tonnes to m tonnes largely due to greater awareness of the food that is not eaten less is ending up in landfill in only of household waste was recycled or composted but by the amount of composted food had risen to van otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging unexpected continuing interest in the subject of food waste enabling grassroots campaigns around the world to gain momentum we have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors he says but if it

clay cockrell is sitting in his office at columbus circle across the street from central park west which houses trump international hotel and tower in front of the tower is central park where cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions cockrell a former wall street worker turned therapist spends large parts of his days walking through central park or the battery park in downtown manhattan near wall street as a confidant and counsellor to some of new yorks wealthiest people i shifted towards it naturally he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy many of the extremely wealthy the of the feel that their problems are really not problems but they are a lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues so what issues are americas struggling with there is guilt over being rich in the first place he said there is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich and then there is the isolation being in the it turns out can be lonely it seems f scott fitzgerald was right the very rich are different from you and me counsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like occupy wall street and the fight for fair wage campaign the occupy wall street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the and painted them globally as something negative said jamie traegermuney a wealth psychologist and founder of the wealth legacy group the media she said is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed sometimes i am shocked by things that people say you would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders its really isolating to have a lot of money peoples reactions to you can be scary said barbara nusbaum an expert in money psychology we are all taught not to talk about money its not polite to talk about money ironically its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money its much more socially acceptable to say i am broke things are hard you cant say i have a ton of money you have to keep a lot of your life private as a result cockrell points out the rich tend to hang out with other rich americans not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems the growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon according to oxfam the richest have seen their share of global wealth increase from in to in and are on track to own more than the other by in the us over the last three decades the wealth owned by the top households increased from to even as the wealth of the bottom of households declined the number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing according to research from spectrem group in the number of us households with m or more in assets excluding the value of their primary home increased by to m in that number was m households worth m or more reached m and households are now worth m or more since the financial crisis the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy cockrell said the main reason not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money someone else who is also a billionaire they dont want anything from you never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means i think that is difficult said cockrell as the gap has widened the rich have become more and more isolated these are real fears faced by the richest of the rich in the gates foundation teamed up with boston colleges center on wealth and philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in americas for the next four years researchers surveyed of americas richest households of those households have at least m in assets the average net worth of those surveyed was m the resulting study the joys and dilemmas of wealth was pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money cant buy happiness wealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about m some americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret we talk about it as stealth wealth there are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment said traegermuney if wealthy americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth people often dismiss their experience people say oh poor you there is not a lot of sympathy there she said wealth is still one of our last taboos speaking in his soft soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them i dont think its healthy to discount your problems if you are part of the you still have problems and they are legitimate to you even when you say i dont have to struggle for money there are other parts of your life money is not the only thing that defines you he said your problems are legitimaten,adv,WNL Wealth therapy

is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream according to the international federation of the phonographic industry ifpi there were just m subscribers using music streaming services globally in it might be the biggest revenue growth area for the record business but it is still incredibly niche not only that but a significant number of those subscribers come from bundled deals with mobile phone operators so it is debatable just how active its users are apples greatest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists in the market downloads itunes digital music players the ipod and smartphones the iphone and adapt it to make it irresistible to the mainstream consumer leaked information recently suggested that apple is aiming to reach m subscribers which based on a subscription fee of per year would generate bn annually to put that in context the entire global worth of recorded music in was just under bn apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good is this the end of downloading the itunes store arrived in in europe at a time when mp piracy seemed insurmountable apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business which it dominated with an estimated market share downloads still hold the biggest share of digital income for recorded music making up of total digital income in according to ifpi numbers apple holds the lions share of this making it the single biggest music retailer in the world but download revenue peaked in in the uk at m and fell to m in the decline in download sales hit the us in so apple bought beats in for bn not only to get into the premium headphone market but also to make the transition from music ownership downloads to music access subscription streaming apple and the record industry cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the apple brand one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker the vast majority of people out there like music but dont love it enough to pay a year to listen to it a sporadic download purchase here and there will suit them just fine the average spend of a music buyer in the uk in for example was just according to research expecting most of them to triple their annual spend on recorded music is something that even apple will seriously struggle with has apple connect made apple the most artistfriendly service apple have previously tried to build an artistfriendly platform via itunes they called it ping and it didnt work apple connect is something very different somewhere in the middle of youtube facebook and soundcloud letting artists post music videos photos and more to their profile pages it couldnt be any more if it tried apple partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as art rather than content has generally had strong relations with not just the music industry but artists themselves and generally it has a good reputation among artists compare that to spotify which has been criticized by artists from radioheads thom yorke to taylor swift in contrast apple comes across as a benevolent uncle there is the smell of revolution in the air and apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up where are the artist exclusives this is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming spotify paid a lot of money to get led zeppelin and metallica exclusively apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes it already has acdc and the beatles catalogues exclusively for download on itunes but it remains to be seen if it can persuade these two to make the jump into streaming it also managed to get the surprise beyonc album in before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that there is plenty of speculation about apple looking to get exclusive rights to the new adele album giving itunes the download exclusive on an album was not that big a leap of faith for acts given just how much of the download market it controls but trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing add into this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the uk and us and artists who still see the chart as a measure of success will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to one service is this going to kill spotify some people are already saying that apple music will destroy rivals like spotify however its not that simple apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years it has a lot of catching up to do the winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service it will be the company with the most money apples competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money spotify for example lost m in apple on the other hand started by becoming the most profitable company in corporate history with bn in the bank if apple music loses apple money the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the competitionn,adv,WNL What does Apple

setting aside epic disastermovie moments such as volcanoes hurricanes and earthquakes there are two key natural factors that can make a city vulnerable to gradual disintegration or even total disappearance water and sand were climate change making the planet colder rather than hotter we could add ice to the list for nothing obliterates a city like a billiontonne glacier grinding its way down a valley the impact of a rare ice tsunami in on the canadian municipality of ochre beach was just a taster a wall of melting iceberg on dauphin lake was blown by winds on to the shore splintering every house in its path but ochre beach was an anomaly elsewhere the planets melting ice is making cities vulnerable by the less dramatic route of raising sea levels a century ago venice one of the most beautiful and lowlying cities in the world used to flood around ten times a year nowadays its lowest point piazza san marco only three feet above sea level is inundated with water approximately times annually but rising sea levels are not entirely to blame in many parts of the world the land is also sinking in venices case subsoil compaction a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area lowered the city by cm between and ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about cm a year but thats nothing compared to jakarta which is dropping to cm annually in the past three decades the city has sunk roughly four metres rendering its yearold seawall ever less effective unfortunately for the indonesian capital it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting thereby creating a bowl rivers that used to flow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill while there are many plans to save venice and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously the same cannot be said for miami where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem miamis difficulties are threefold the florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city and it is built on porous limestone which is absorbing the rising seawater this water then fills the citys foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water there is every chance miami may one day become uninhabitable in the maldives the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes the capital mal population and only four feet above sea level has used japanese investment to build a tenfoot sea wall at a cost of million but long term only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands and its not just the sea rainfall is also endangering cities across the world recently an entire summers worth of rain fell in one morning on detroit overwhelming its outdated sewerage systems impoverished by the collapse of americas car industry the city is struggling to build a system to cope drinking water is also affected because detroit is particularly vulnerable to waterborne pathogens in africa desertification is causing the sahara to spread south at a rate of miles per year threatening settlements in northern mauritania over the past years for example the desert has grown by more than acres around the trading and religious centre of chinguetti which has seen its population decline from people in the midtwentieth century to just a few thousand now trading has all but ceased as sand piles up in the streets likewise the californian resort of rancho mirage near palm springs may have to be abandoned in the next decade this city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human overexpansion in the face of finite resources californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million in but now the state is home to million people who between them own million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses the daily water use in rancho mirage is more than gallons per person which is giving rise to a manmade drought a cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort which is surrounded by sand and dust the longterm answer in californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others human flight is the final proof of a citys disintegration once we stop maintaining a city nature takes over very quickly japans hashima island was turned into a concrete city in to exploit undersea coal reserves but in with coal supplies nearing depletion the mine was closed and hashima was abandoned now the sea spray is causing its concrete walls to collapse fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in america in fact forest fires cause the most damage after severe storms with major fire disasters having been declared there between and a newly released report by the usda forest service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire similarly in australia some of victorias resorts and several melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the states most vulnerable bushfire spots because longterm droughts are making trees highly combustible its unlikely that a forest fire will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of fires could render it uninhabitable and abandonment remains one of the most powerful causes of urban collapse many cities are fighting a losing battle against the ravages of nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable metropolis natural events are notoriously hard to predict but

apart from volcanoes hurricanes and earthquakes there are two key things that can make a city disintegrate or even totally disappear water and sand a century ago venice one of the most beautiful and lowlying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year nowadays its lowest point piazza san marco only three feet above sea level is inundated with water approximately times a yearn but rising sea levels are not the only cause in many parts of the world the land is also sinking in venice subsoil compaction a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area lowered the city by cm between and ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about cm a year but thats nothing compared to jakarta which is dropping to cm each year in the past three decades the city has sunk roughly four metres unfortunately for the indonesian capital it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting this has created a bowl rivers that used to ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphilln while there are many plans to save venice and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously the same cannot be said for miami where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problemn there are three problems in miami it is less than ten feet above sea level an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city and it is built on porous rock which is absorbing the rising seawater this water then lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water it is possible that miami may one day become uninhabitablen in the maldives the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes the capital male population and only four feet above sea level has built a tenfoot sea wall at a cost of million but long term only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islandsn in africa deserti cation is causing the sahara to spread south at a rate of miles per year threatening settlements in northern mauritania over the past years for example the desert has grown by more than acres around the trading and religious centre of chinguetti where the population has declined from people in the midtwentieth century to just a few thousand now trading has almost completely stopped as sand piles up in the streets likewise the californian resort of rancho mirage near palm springs may have to be abandoned in the next decade this city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human overexpansion californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million in but now the state is home to million people who own million vehiclesn the daily water use in rancho mirage is more than gallons per person which is causing a manmade drought a cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort which is surrounded by sand and dust the longterm answer in californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some citiesn fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in america in fact forest res cause the most damage after severe storms with major re disasters there between and a new report by the usda forest service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wild ren similarly in australia some of victorias resorts and several melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the states most vulnerable bush re spots because longterm droughts are making trees highly combustible its unlikely that a forest re will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of res could make it uninhabitable many cities are ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to identify the worldxs most vulnerable city natural events are very dif cult to predict x but malexxs future looks particularly bad because even if its new sea wall continues to be effective the islands around the maldives capital are going to disappear before too long and if they disappear malexxs raison dxextre disappears toon n n,in,WNL What is world's
how long can you hold your breath im trying it right now the first seconds are easy im ready to give up at seconds but i push on through and it seems to get easier for a while but as the second hand ticks past a minute i know im on borrowed time my heart is pounding i let out a tiny breath and this helps eventually i give in expelling the spent air in my lungs and taking a huge gasp and continue to gasp for a few more breaths prompting my husband to ask what on earth im doing i manage one minute and seconds im quite impressed with myself breathholding ability becomes extremely important in some sports particularly freediving in i was filming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a bbc series called slightly oddly dont die young i was lucky enough to meet sam amps who was captain of the uk freedive team at a pool in bristol she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater by the end of the session i think id managed a prodigious seconds of breathholding enough to let me swim a width sam swam three widths with ease she could hold her breath for five minutes while swimming five i asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive then a big deep breath before diving in she also said training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episode in human evolution its even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breathhold for even longer other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs our hairlessness the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development unfortunately the cobbledtogether aquatic ape hypothesis fails to hold water its a romantic notion that may appeal to us but with the cold light of day falling on the scientific evidence its revealed to be nothing more than a fiction looking at voluntary breathholding it turns out that were certainly not unique among nonaquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath having said that its a difficult thing to investigate in other mammals as unlike humans they tend not to comply when you ask them to breathhold and experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnt drop during breathholding at least it doesnt if youre breathholding on land when youre submerged in cold water its a different story cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people but once again this isnt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of airbreathing vertebrates this reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the mammalian diving reflex but physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also and perhaps even more importantly useful for not drowning while our ability to breathhold may not be all that special when we compare ourselves with other animals its now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation very precisely at the tumour this may require several minutes worth of radiation and so its usually done in short bursts between breaths but if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes it means that the entire dose can be delivered in the right place in one go the problem of course is that most people just like me struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute but doctors at university hospital birmingham have recently performed careful experiments that show that if patients are ventilated with oxygenrich air before attempting a breath hold they can manage to hold their breath for an impressive fiveandahalf minutes surprisingly the trick seems to lie not in fooling the bodys usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm when you breathe in youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm pulling it flat so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs when you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state artificially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breathhold as in the birmingham radiotherapy experiments may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm and not so useful if youre trying to keep your chest perfectly still breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little and helps you to prolong a breathhold exactly as i found when attempting my breathhold and so its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breathhold eventually even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in and take a breathn,adv,WNL What's the secret

striding on stage donald trump had a surprisingly humble confession to make for someone defying all the laws of political gravity unless we win it doesnt mean a damn thing the wouldbe republican presidential nominee warned a campaign rally in south carolina despite finishing his fourth month in a row at the top of the opinion polls i want to pick my date for the election i want it next tuesday he confided to the strong crowd typical of the grassroots support that needs to flourish into march for him to win the nomination let alone novembers general election such moments of selfdoubt are fleeting quickly replaced by the nowfamiliar bombast of a billionaire whose status as a winner has become his defining policy platform trump is not the only one beginning to wonder whether his improbable campaign can confound the pundits and go the distance particularly after a burst of recent controversy only seemed to cement his polling lead over bewildered rivals conventional wisdom holds that any one of these outbursts would have sunk most politicians by now first there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of vietnam veteran john mccain because he allowed himself to be captured then there was the first television debate where he insulted fox news moderator megyn kelly because she asked him difficult questions as if pows fox news and women were not enemies enough trump has also insulted mexican immigrants to the us claimed that a black lives matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be roughed up appeared to mock a new york times journalist for his disability and falsely accused muslim americans of cheering on the attackers trump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by the political media of whom he says are scum but he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments i could have said oh i misspoke but i am not big on that trump told the crowd in south carolina some rivals still hope that eventually even trumps supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular one poll shows his support among republicans down by points although at he still leads the field other opponents question whether there is much overarching political ideology to trump he is an egomaniac hes a narcissist hes not a conservative hes not a liberal he believes in himself former presidential rival bobby jindal told the guardian shortly before dropping out of the race liz mair a republican strategist organizing an anti trump fundraising committee worries that many of the comments seen as gaffes by the liberal media are in fact carefully designed to boost his standing with his core constituency i personally think its best that people who dont like trump and his policies do some work to try to actively undercut him she says and not just pray for him to commit real political suicide yet there is more to trump than attentiongrabbing outrage as he delights in telling supporters the three issues that he rails against most immigration reform freetrade deals and barack obamas national security policy have become perhaps the defining issues of the election his policies for deporting every undocumented immigrant in the us and demanding that mexico pays for a border wall a real wall a very tall wall taller than that ceiling might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of jeb bush who favours immigration reform so what might it take to stop trump one source of optimism among opponents is the strong evidence that polls this far away from election day are an average of eight percentage points out simply because most people have not made up their minds among americans who identify as republicans current polls suggest he has of the vote in the battle for hearts and minds converting trumps passionate supporters will be hard to blunt his lead another candidate would need to tap into his support base without jeopardizing their own polling experts believe this to be unlikely as it is hard to imagine anyone doing trump better than trump let alone anyone doing trump without sacrificing their own support this scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question are there any of these candidates you would definitely not support for the republican nomination for president while of voters say they would support trump another say they definitely would not steve deace a prominent iowa conservative said that trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing on one hand it produces a loyal following that is attracted to that persona which will not leave you on the other hand it limits your ability to grow beyond that top republican pollster frank luntz believes trump speaks for voters who for the first time feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are being heard as the pollster notes trump says what theyre thinking and the more outrageous he is the more they agree with him hes saying what no politician would say and thats another reason they like him that is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months i like the way he speaks says sandra murray of dubuque iowa this country is a huge mess and we need to get out of this and honestly he could be the man to do it other supporters offer a simpler explanation hes not afraid of anybody or anything thats pretty cooln,adv,WNL Who can stop Trump

sometimes life just isnt fair mark zuckerberg created facebook and is now worth an estimated bn james goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day the cash machine but it didnt make him rich in fact he earned just from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since you can imagine how i feel when i see bankers getting m bonuses i wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than i did to merit a m bonus it doesnt make much sense to me but thats the way of the world goodfellow says it also annoys him that hes not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers he came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds and i got nothing so whos going to want to follow in james goodfellows footsteps and get if they have a fantastic success there have been arguments for years over who should officially go down in history as the inventor of the atm and in a man called john shepherdbarron received a uk honour for services to banking as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser but the uk government is now saying it was goodfellow who invented the atm so it would seem that after all the squabbling his place in history is now assured back in the mids goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on saturdays most people working during the week couldnt get to the bank they wanted a solution the solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer he recalls i set out to develop a cashissuing machine and to make this a reality i invented the pin personal identification number and an associated coded token this token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it the patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated when the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten pushbuttons in accordance with his personal identification number aside from the cards with punched holes that pretty much describes todays atm after goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model prototypes were built and the first machines were installed in at around the same time shepherdbarron was developing a rival cashdispensing device his machine didnt use plastic cards instead it used cheques impregnated with carbon a mildly radioactive substance the machine detected the carbon matched the cheque against a pin and paid out the cash it is widely accepted that the shepherdbarron atm was the worlds first when it comes to being installed and used by the public the first one at a bank in north london was opened on june a month before goodfellows atm made its public debut however the patent for goodfellows machine was lodged on may months before the london atm machine came into service the rivalry between the two men bubbled up when shepherdbarron received an official honour for his achievement goodfellow says my one big regret is that i never said anything about it until john shepherdbarron received the obe in this honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser that really stuck in my throat and i kicked up a bit of a fuss shepherdbarron is no longer alive to put his case but in a interview he was fairly withering about his rival i dont know him but its clear that the difference between goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it his invention reminds me of the hovercraft an elegant failure the cash machine has become a worldconquering piece of technology and nothing the contactless revolution bitcoin wearable technology etc seems to be slowing its growth there are now m atms worldwide with the number forecast to hit m by goodfellow accepts he didnt invent the concept of a cashissuing machine but i did invent a way of doing it when people talk about the wright brothers they didnt invent the concept of flying everyone was trying to do it but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so i think i should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser the good news for goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen the website atminventorcom concludes who invented the idea of an atm we believe it was luther george simjian who invented the atm as we know it we have to think it was james goodfellow in scotland for holding a patent date of who invented the atm design we recognize today we think it was john d white for docutel in the us even better for goodfellow his achievement has been officially recognized in the latest edition of a page guidebook called life in the united kingdom in the section about great british inventions of the twentieth century it states in the s james goodfellow invented the cashdispensing automatic teller machine atm or cashpoint so after all these years goodfellow finally finds himself being talked about in the same breath as john logie baird the television alan turing the turing machine sir frank whittle the jet engine and sir tim bernerslee the world wide web asked what he did with the he received back in the s goodfellow

how far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages if amazon is to be believed not far at all others are not so sure technical progress past this point isnt merely a matter of invention its a matter of public safety paul misener amazons vicepresident of global public policy told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place but misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technologys viability the federal aviation authority faa will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arent airwaylegal at all yet only drones up to kg will be covered and the faa points out in the proposed rules that if youre going to crowd the skies with radiocontrolled flying robots they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack professor sajiv singh of carnegie mellon university robotics institute who runs a critical cargo delivery company called nearearth said that piloting a stateoftheart drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs go to this altitude perform this short task go back home but even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems he said theyre not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place theyre proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is which is likely an urban area or a suburban area he said in those particular cases there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnt know about unless youve mapped that exact route before even then maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there but is there now maybe gps signals are blocked or partially blocked in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is all this is surmountable he said but its difficult one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks if you have an offtheshelf uav unmanned aerial vehicle itll just keep going and crash into the ground said roboticist daniel huber thats not a hard problem for an engineer to fix its just that the fix isnt yet an industry standard furthermore you cant do everything with a kg aircraft said jay mcconville director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor lockheed martin mst much of the focus at lockheed martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate flight simulators those of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result he said operators want to see vehicle status information they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop technologically most of the things that are needed for this are in place said huber he is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure pipelines telephone lines bridges and so on weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and itll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back huber a senior scientist at carnegie mellons robotics institute where he works on d systems imagery said with respect to a program like amazons i have heard them say that many packages are lightweight a drone can carry a kilogram for minutes if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood it can deliver from that base you need a minute distance and typical offtheshelf drones have about that distance its one way he said of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe the larger you get the more dangerous you get logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways huber said at a recent conference he said a disaster relief drone firm skycatch demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and when it got tired land on its own charging station it would land and take off and when it ran low on batteries it would land exchange the batteries and take off again he said of course safety remains a major concern singh points out that for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every m hours drones he said are one or two orders of magnitude away from that benchmark the reaper drone has one failure in hours singh said an oil leak by the way doesnt count as catastrophic failure something has to fall out of the sky were closing the gap singh said theres a lot of interest part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and thus standards are much higher if you fly commercial

brown paper bag filled with essentials including pasta eggs and cornflakes and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables maria is the th client so far today at east hampton food pantry a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world by the end of the day the food pantrys organizers expect more than families to have followed maria through the doors to collect their weekly food parcel to help them get through the cold dark long island winter in the summertime the hamptons a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages miles from manhattan is a billionaires playground but come labor day in early september when the rich and famous shut up their mansions and head back to manhattan or beverly hills the glitz gives way to the gritty reality of life for the mostly immigrant community who live here all year the people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not says maria who works hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter maria laughs when asked if she has enough money there is no work in the winter only in the summertime says maria who like many of the workers in the hamptons is from latin america here lots of people live in a single room because they cant pay the rent she says some families with up to five children are crammed into basements and still pay more than a month in rent people come here looking for work but in the winter there is nothing lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the east hampton food pantry she says which is just one of several food pantries in the town vicki littman chairperson of the east hampton food pantry which provided more than food parcels in says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing once labor day comes and the season is over and peoples hours start to be cut back our numbers go up to about families a week she says when they come to us on tuesday they get two to three days worth of food without us they would struggle that much more littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess when i discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries theyre always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here but what people dont realize is that there is that service industry its the landscapers the nannies the waitresses they are all relying on that summer income to get them through the winter but people dont see that when theyre coming out on holiday there are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food and that shouldnt be the case littman says the town has lost too many people working key jobs such as teachers police officers and even doctors and dentists because they cant afford to live in the community and the food pantry board is determined to do more to ensure people have a better shot at staying put housing is by far the biggest cost in the hamptons at m the nations most expensive property is hedge fund manager barry rosensteins acre beachfront estate at further lane a stones throw from maidstone golf club which is considered the most elite prestigious and difficult to get into of all the hamptons clubs larry cantwell east hamptons town supervisor and lifelong resident says homes regularly change hands at more than m and the rapid price inflation at the top end has trickled down to even the towns most modest flats finding your first home is a challenge in an area like this cantwell says not just people who you would characterize as poor working and middleclass families are also having a hard time if you can find a home to buy anywhere in east hampton for youre very lucky cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year which causes the population to dwindle to as little as in the winter months compared with in august its kind of the tale of two cities theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer says cantwell the son of a fisherman father and a housecleaner mother but the rest of us live here year round there are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hardworking and poor people struggling to get by youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and fishing community of people who lived off the land and the water a real workingclass community cantwell says saving up enough money to buy your first house while working as a farmer or fisherman is nearimpossible in east hampton today and its not just the poor police officers teachers young professionals and others all struggle to find a place to live here and many of them cannot afford to own their own home being homeless in the hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter churches up and down the north and south fork of long island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly homeless people are bussed between them every day eddie vallone is one of those on the bus every night people look at the hamptons as some sort of rich town and theres no problems going on but there are a lot of problems here especially drugs its hard to really grasp ok the summer is coming to an end what am i going to do for the winter vallone says at maureens haven a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme i want to work but theres no work to be done vallone who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates says that if he saves well and doesnt

it is not just the worlds biggest burger chain it is also a global emblem of american consumer capitalism but these days the golden arches of mcdonalds are looking a little tarnished after a decade of expansion customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more mcdonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by on in a set of results that were described as atrocious problems are piling up almost everywhere in china sales plunged by after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claiming to use outofdate beef and chicken in products destined for mcdonalds and kfc in europe sales are down by mostly because of unrest in ukraine and the sour antiwestern mood in russia around of mcdonalds restaurants in russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated foodsafety checks ten have been closed but it is in the us where mcdonalds has around of its restaurants where the crisis runs deepest almost years after ray kroc opened his first restaurant in des plaines illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries mcdonalds has seen straight months of declining sales in its massive home market with sales down in the latest quarter younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as chipotle mexican grill the number of toyearolds visiting mcdonalds once a month has fallen by since according to food analysts technomic while the number of toyear olds visiting has not grown to add to the companys problems mcdonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than american diners who said they would rather eat a burger at five guys smashburger or fuddruckers fastgrowing usonly chain chickfila was considered to be best for chicken mcdonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals especially chipotle which trumpets its antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal produce although local for chipotle can mean miles away the depth of consumer mistrust of mcdonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the us in october have you ever used pink slime in your burgers was one question on the our food your questions website referring to the controversial beef filler gristle and fat used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it fit for human consumption the meat product banned in europe since the bse crisis was dropped by mcdonalds in but pink slime has left doubts in us consumers minds does mcdonalds beef contain worms asked another person no gross end of story replied the company others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the mcrib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats mcdonalds chief executive don thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness quality and integrity of its ingredients yet just as mcdonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier it has also lost its edge in fastfood essentials speedy service at low prices ever since it introduced items on its dollar menu it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals while many consumers complain that service is slower the expensive tag was unjustified said mary chapman at technomic prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastservice chains in the us prices at mcdonalds have increased by since well below the quick service sector average up while the cost of fast casual eating a category that includes the muchhyped chipotle is up according to technomics menu monitor us consumer prices rose over the same period but critics have a point when it comes to longer queues mcdonalds has a bigger menu than some with more complicated items its chicken mcwrap takes seconds to make i think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said chapman in the uk mcdonalds has turned around its business making britain a rare bright spot for the company a competitive breakfast menu improved coffee and free wifi had given mcdonalds a broad appeal in the uk said peter martin of consultancy cga peach whose figures show that of british adults have visited a mcdonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market thompson has promised more organic food and custommade burgers but to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of simpler menus and greater choice over fillings they want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky said mark kalinowski at janney capital markets only four out of mcdonalds us restaurants had so far tested build your own burger he said raising questions about how it could be scaled up right now we are sceptical we would like to see more detail meanwhile despite the declining sales the chain continues to expand
